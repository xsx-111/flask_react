Midnight Show Lyrics
I know what you want
I'm gonna take you to a midnight show tonight
If you can keep a secret
I got a blanket in the back seat on my mind

And a little place that sits beneath the sky
She turned her face to speak but no-one heard her cry

Drive faster, boy
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh

I know there's a hope
There's too many people trying to help me cope
You got a real short skirt
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah, yeah
We were just in time
Let me take a little more off your mind
There's something in my head, somewhere in the back, saying
"We were just a good thing, we were such a good thing"

Make it go away without a word
But promise me you'll stay and fix these things I've heard
Oh, make it go away
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh
Oh, no

A crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
Of stars in atmosphere and watched her disappear

Into the midnight show
Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret, I can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret9Embed
