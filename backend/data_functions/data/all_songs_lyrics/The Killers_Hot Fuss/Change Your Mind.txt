Change Your Mind Lyrics
Racey days help me through the hopeless haze
But my, oh, my
Tragic eyes, I can't even recognize myself
Behind

So if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?

Out again, a siren screams at half-past ten
And you won't let go
While I ignore, that we've both felt like this before
It starts to show

So if I have a chance
Would you let me know?

Why aren't you shaking?
Step back in time
Graciously taken
Oh, you're too kind
And if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?

We're all the same and love is blind
The sun is gone before it shines

And I said, if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
If the answer is no
Can I change your mind?9Embed
