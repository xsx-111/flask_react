Believe Me Natalie Lyrics
Believe me, Natalie, listen, Natalie
This is your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now
Please believe me, Natalie, listen Natalie
This is your last chance to find a go-go dance to disco now
Forget what they said in SoHo, leave the "Oh, no"s out
And believe me, Natalie, listen Natalie
This is your last chance

There is an old cliche under your Monet, baby
Remember the arch of roses right above your couch?
Forget what they said in SoHo, leave the "Oh, no"s out
Yes, there is an old cliche under your Monet, baby

You left the station now to the floor with speculation
What was it for?
In that old hallway, Mom says, "Why don't you stay?
You've been away for a long time"

Believe me, Natalie
This is your last chance to find a go-go
Forget what they said in SoHo
And walk away
If my dreams for us can't get you through just one more day
It's alright by me
God, help me somehow
There's no time for survival left
The time is now
'Cause this might be your last chance to disco, oh-oh, oh-oh7Embed
