By My Side Lyrics
They blazed a trail I dared to run
They built this world and I have come
I need another, like a brother
For a cryin' shoulder

This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

Sober mind, time now is gone
They carved my body not of stone
A pretty maze of emptiness
I said, "To hell with all the rest"

This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?

This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?
This could be the last time
You will stand by my side
I can feel my soul, it’s bleeding
Will you fly with me this evening?Embed
