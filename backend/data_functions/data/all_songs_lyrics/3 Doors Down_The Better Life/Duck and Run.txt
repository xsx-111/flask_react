Duck and Run Lyrics
To this world, I'm unimportant
Just because I have nothing to give
So you call this your free country
Tell me why it costs so much to live
Tell me why

This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away (oh no)
I won’t turn around

All my work and endless measures
Never seem to get me very far
Walk a mile just to move an inch now
Even though I'm trying so damn hard
I'm trying so hard

This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away
And I won’t duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I'm already here
Oh, no, I am already here
Down on my knees
I am already here (on no)
I'm already here
I must have told you a thousand times
I'm not running away

I won’t duck and run
I won’t duck and run
I won’t duck and run
No, I won't pass away

This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away
And I won’t duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I'm already here
This world can turn me down
But I won’t turn away
And I won’t duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I'm already here2Embed
