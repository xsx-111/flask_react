Down Poison Lyrics
I've dreamed about this, sixteen days away
Now you're here, and my head lays
Beside your body, pillowed under mine
You were poison, spinning 'round my mind

"Welcome to my world" she said
"Do you feel alive?" she said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
"Welcome to my world" she said
Separated world, she stayed separated
Down poison, down poison

Body withered, body died
Time to take away this life
Bad enough to die from one, not to mention four or five

"Welcome to my world" she said
"Do you feel alive?" she said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
"Welcome to my world" she said
Separated world, she stayed separated
Down poison, down poison
(Down poison) You weren't there for me, I was there for you
(Down poison) You weren't there for me, I was there for you
(Down poison) You weren't there for me, I was there for you
(Down poison) You weren't there for me, never there for me
(Down poison) You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you
(Down poison) You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you
(Down poison) You wouldn't die for me, I've already died for you
(Down) You wouldn't die, you wouldn't die, you wouldn't die, no!

"Welcome to my world" she said
"Do you feel alive?" she said
It's all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
"Welcome to my world" she said
Separated world, she stayed separated
Down poison, down poison
Down poison, down poison, downEmbed
