Loser Lyrics
Breathe in right away
Nothing seems to fill this place
I need this every time
So take your lies, get off my case
Someday I will find
A love that flows through me like this
This will fall away
This will fall away

You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser
I'm a loser, yeah

This is getting old
I can't break these chains that I hold
My body's growing cold
There's nothing left of this mind or my soul
Addiction needs a pacifier
The buzz of this poison is taking me higher
And this will fall away
This will fall away
You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
Cause I’m a loser, I’m a loser, yeah
You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
Cause I’m a loser, I’m a loser, yeah
You're getting closer
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later, you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
Cause I’m a loser, I’m a loser, yeah3Embed
