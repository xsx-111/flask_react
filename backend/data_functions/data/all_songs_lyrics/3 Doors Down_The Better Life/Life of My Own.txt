Life of My Own Lyrics
Living risky, never scared
Wander closer to the edge
Nothing valued think no fear
Always wondering why you're here
All your purposes are gone
Nothing's right and nothing's wrong
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Feel no sorrow, feel no pain

Kiss me while I'm still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky
Let me die on my own terms
Let me live and let me learn
Now I'll follow my own way
And I'll live on to another damn day
Freedom carries sacrifice
Remember when this was my life

Looking forward, not behind
Everybody's got to cross that line
Free me now to give me a place
Keep me caged and free the beast
Falling faster, time goes by
Fear is not seen through these eyes
What there was will never be
Now I'm blind and cannot see
Kiss me while I’m still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky
Let me die on my own terms
Let me live and let me learn
Now I’ll follow my own way
And I’ll live on to another damn day
Freedom carries sacrifice
Remember when this was my life
Kiss me while I’m still alive
Kill me while I kiss the sky
Let me die on my own terms
Let me live and let me learn
Now I’ll follow my own way
And I’ll live on to another damn day
Freedom carries sacrifice
Remember when this was my life1Embed
