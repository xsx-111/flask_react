Not Enough Lyrics
Seven days underpaid, gotta give it up
Got no time for this life that I’m living up
Shackled down, kicked around, now slave to the grind
Need some time for myself

I’ll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time, so I’ll get up with you
If you don't understand, man, you’ve gotta believe
There's too much of you, but there's not enough of me
There's not enough of me

Same old song, world moves on while I’m still in bed
Meet tomorrow today just to get ahead
Jump the gun on the run
I’m the only one who thinks I’m falling behind

I’ll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time, so I’ll get up with you
If you don't understand, man, you’ve gotta believe
There's too much of you, but there's not enough of me
There's not enough of me
I’ll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time, so I’ll get up with you
If you don't understand, man, you’ve gotta believe
There's too much of you, there's too much of me
I’ll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time, so I’ll get up with you
If you don't understand, man, you’ve gotta believe
There's too much of you, but there's not enough of me
There's not enough of meEmbed
