Ecstacy LyricsAddicted to poison
The poison is the cure sometimes
I have a secret
The secret's written in the sky
I need to go down slow
I need to get up to the stars
I have a secret
Baby baby baby
You're like ecstasy
Maybe maybe maybe that's because I am on it
Baby baby baby
Maybe baby baby
I'm gonna take some innocence from you
Addicted to poison
The poison is the cure sometimes
I have a secret
The secret's written in the sky
I need to go down slow
I need to get up to the stars
I have a secret
Baby baby baby
You're like ecstasy
Maybe maybe maybe that's because I am on it
Baby baby baby
Maybe baby baby
I'm gonna take some innocence from youEmbed
