I Need To Say Goodbye LyricsI know you just want to kill me
I still reached out my hand to you like
End the pain inside
An innocent child
You took me for a ride
You took me for all the other fools in your life
Now I don't care about your pain anymore
I need to say goodbye
It's easy to forget
You're worth nothing to me
What you've done to me
You took me for a ride
Now I don't care about your pain anymore
You took me for all the other fools in your life
The world is filled with sunshine, love and roses
You bleed enough and then the bleeding stops
What you've done to me
Now I don't care about your pain anymore
You took me for a ride
You took me for all the other fools in your life
I need to say goodbye
Now I don't care about your pain anymore
I don't care about your pain anymoreyou took me for all the other fools in your lifeEmbed
