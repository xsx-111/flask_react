Winter In My Heart LyricsI need a summer but the summer's come and gone...
I need a summer but it's winter in my heart...
It's all the same
The fucked up game
You play with me!
I need to hold you but you're never coming back...
I can't get
Any lower...
I can't find
All the pieces of my broken life...
I need a summer but the summer's come and gone...
I need a summer like a winter in my heart...
I can't get
Any lower...
I can't find
All the pieces of my broken life...
But I try
I still try
I still try...Embed
