Desert Garden LyricsDo you feel like I do, tired of everything
Can you feel what I can, almost everything
I wanna leave today...
The sky is big and my life is small
I wanna leave with you so we can build a perfect garden
The stars are far away, I can see them with my eyes
I watch them burn away, like the moments of my life
I wanna leave today...
The sky is big and my life is small
I wanna leave with you, so we can build a Desert Garden
The stars are far away, I can see them with my eyes
I watch them fade away, like the moments of my life
Strange how the house is there exactly all the same
And your just a slave like me; at least I know it's true
I wanna leave today...
The sky is big and my life is small
I wanna leave with you so we can build a Desert Garden
The stars are far away, I can see them in my eyes
We watch them fade away, like the moments of my life...Embed
