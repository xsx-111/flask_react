Japanese Fantasy LyricsA Rocketship took me so far away
From the field where I had lost my way

On a Rocketship that lost control
All I ever wanted was to feel like I have done something with my life....
All I ever felt was YOU
A Rocketship took me so far away
From the field where I had lost my way
All I felt was YOU
All I ever wanted was to feel like I have done something with my life....
All I felt was YOUEmbed
