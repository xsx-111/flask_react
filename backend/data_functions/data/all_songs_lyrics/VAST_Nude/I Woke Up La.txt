I Woke Up La LyricsI woke up la
Then I went to sleep
I saw so many things
I know that you saw too
I walked a thousand miles
In clothes that children made
I felt so many things
I know that you felt too
Please forgive me, you know I lost my mind
Please forgive me, you know I lost the time
To say I love you
I woke up la
Maybe it's a dream
To be with those who play
Dress up, make believe
I flew a thousand miles
On wings that children made
With all the things you get
When you don't have anything
Please forgive me, cause I forgot my lines
Please forgive me, while I still have time
Say you love me, yeah say you love me, yeah yeah
I woke up la
To sound the sirens song
Everything is great
And everything is wrong
I flew a thousand miles
To kiss my mother's name
Yeah, It's the thing you get
When you don't want anything
Please forgive me, yeah
Please forgive me, yeah
Say you love me
Ooh, say you love me, yeahEmbed
