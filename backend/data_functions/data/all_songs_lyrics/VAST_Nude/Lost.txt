Lost LyricsThere's no Angels here
Just a sun to light their way
The places where we were friends turn to strangers
Ooooo my lover on a long, long empty road
Ooooo sweet lover, I got Lost
There's no Angels here
Just a light to lead the way
There's not innocence just estrangement
Oooooo my lover on a long, long empty road
Ooooo sweet lover I got Lost
Ah I need to get back home....
Ooooo my lover on a long, long empty road
Ooooo sweet lover I got Lost
Ah I need to get back home....Embed
