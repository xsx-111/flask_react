Candle LyricsJust take this candle, it's the one you gave to me
It has enough light, just enough to torture me
Just take this candle, it's the one you gave to me
I left you crying at the alter of your mind
Before you let the world mess up your soul
Oooooooh, oooooooooooooh, ooh
I lit the candle used to light your hair on fire
I left you dying in the shelter of your mind
Before you let the world mess up your soul
Try to be the girl you once were
Oooooooh, ooooooooooooh
Oooooooh, ooooooooooooh, OohEmbed
