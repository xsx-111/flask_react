Turquoise LyricsLooking for a penny on an empty beach
I've been looking for a lover who has eyes to see
While we're there I wanna walk with you and hold your hand in the sun...
In the sun...
In the sun...
Turquoisence colour I need to get clean
The forest burned and with it something inside me
Looking for a way to leave the world today
While the world is gonna leave us all anyway
While I'm here I wanna walk with you and hold your hand in the sun... In the sun...
Turquoisence colour I need to get clean
The forest burned and with it something inside me
Together
Together
Together
Together
Together in the sun...
I need to get clean
I need, I need, I need, I need, I need
Turquoisence colour I need to get clean
The forest burned and with it something inside me
Looking for a way to leave the world today...Embed
