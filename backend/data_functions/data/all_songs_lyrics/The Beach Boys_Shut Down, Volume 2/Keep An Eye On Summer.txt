Keep An Eye On Summer Lyrics
Keep an eye on Summer this year
Keep an eye on Summer
Keep an eye on

We said goodbye last September
Your words I still can hear

Those things I say in my letters
You'll find them most sincere
Keep an eye on Summer this year-ear-ear
Soon we'll be graduating
And we'll be so far apart
And though you could be dating
I'm waiting and waiting
And as we look at the future
Though it be through a tear
