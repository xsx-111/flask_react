Pom Pom Play Girl Lyrics
Rah rah pom pom play girl
Pom pom play girl

(Oooooo)
You see her in a short skirt down on the grass
She's wondering if the team's going to run kick or pass
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
Since she doesn't really know why she's waving her hands
She's a-thinking 'bout the boy sitting up in the stands


(Chi chi bah)
Just a little social clique with the other song queens
With a freshman or a sophomore she wouldn't be seen
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She's a doll and she knows it and she thinks that her face
Will get her any body any thing and any place


Chi chi bah (Oooooo)
Since she's the head cheerleader she dates the quarterback
And her best friend's going out with the full back
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She might even run for an office this Spring
And that ought to really make her telephone ring

(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wooooo
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wooo
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Shake it
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wave those pom poms all around
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wow
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wow
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)Embed
