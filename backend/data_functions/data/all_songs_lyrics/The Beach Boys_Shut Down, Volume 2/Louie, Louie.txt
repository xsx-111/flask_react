(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Well me got to go
(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Fine little girl
(Duh duh)
She waits for me
(Duh duh)
I catch a ship
(Duh duh)
And cross the sea
(Duh duh)
Sail that ship
(Duh duh)
Well all alone
(Duh duh)
And never think
(Duh duh)
I'll make it home
(Duh duh)

Louie Louie
(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Well me got to go
Three nights and days I sail the sea
Me think of girls a-constantly
I'm on the ship me dream she there
Me smell the rose a-in her hair
I said Louie Louie
Oh baby now me got to go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Louie Louie
Oh baby now me got to go

Word
I see Jamaica
(Duh duh)
Beautiful
(Duh duh)
It won't be long
(Duh duh)
Until I see my love
(Duh duh)
I'll take her in
(Duh duh)
My arms again
(Duh duh)
I'll tell her I
(Duh duh)
Will never leave again

(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Well me got to go

(Duh duh)
I say me got to go now
(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Me got to goEmbed
