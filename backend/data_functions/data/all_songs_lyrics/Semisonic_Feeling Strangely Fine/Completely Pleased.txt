Completely Pleased LyricsI wanted to leave you completely pleased
Sleep drifting above you, sweetly released
Want to see you smiling
Weak in the knees
I want to see you come, come
Completely pleased
I want to give you something
Priceless and free, and free
I wanted to leave you completely pleased
Sleep drifting above you, sweetly complete
Want to see you hazy
Dazed and confused
I want to see you come, come
Completely used up
I want to give you something
Forever and true, and true
Oh, you broke it
Now, you bought it
So, you might as well use it while you got it
Do what you want to do
I wanted to leave you completely pleased
Sleep drifting above you, sweetly at peace
I want to see you hazy
Weak in the knees
I want to see you come, come
Completely pleased
I want to give you something
Priceless and free, and free
I wanted to leave you completely pleased
I wanted to leave you completely pleased
Alright, stop it nowEmbed
