Beautiful Regret LyricsI would so like to see you
After so many miles away
After so many lonely days
In my place
I would so love to meet you
In some out of the way space
Where nobody knows your name
Or my face
Yes, I know you don't really know me very well
But if I only promise and pretend
You will get to see what we could have had
And yet it's easier to be someone's beautiful regret
Beautiful regret
Beautifulâ€”
I would so like to be true to the opposites in me
To the contradictions sleeping in my mind
You would love to treat me to what you already gave away
But you only have one night, one bed, one life
Well, I don't really know you very well
But if you only promise and pretend
I will get to see what we could have had
And yet it's easier to be someone's beautiful regret
Nearly feel what we know we will never get
Still it's sweet to be someone's beautiful regret
Regret
Beautiful regret
Beautiful regret
Beautiful regret
Beautiful regret
