Long Way from Home LyricsWell, the one-man band is on his way again
After all the leaves have turned
And the long way 'round, it is his only friend
After all his bridges are burned
He says bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Now he's going away for good
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Better do like you should
Now you better be good now
There's a lot more sugar and a lot less snow
In the places where he needs to go
There's a long, long list of everywhere but home
That's exactly where he's dying to roam
He says bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Yes, he's going away for good
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Better do like you should
Everybody be good now
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Yes, he's going away for good
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
He says bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Yes, he's going away for good
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Better do like you should
Yeah, you better be good now
He says bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Yes, he's going away for good
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Better do like you should
Everybody be good now
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Yes, he's going away for good
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from home
A long way from homeEmbed
