She Spreads Her Wings LyricsAt night she spreads her wings
She dreams of bigger things
She floats above the town
She sings without a sound
She can be anywhere at all
She can be anyone at all
A glow and then a shine
What she hoped she would find
Tonight, tonight
She's got a picture in her mind
She can be anyone at all
At night she changed her mind
She left the world behindEmbed
