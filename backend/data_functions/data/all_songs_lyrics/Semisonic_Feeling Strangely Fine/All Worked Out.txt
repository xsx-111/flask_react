All Worked Out LyricsShe's got it all worked out in her mind
And you're part of the plan
And you don't have the final word
She's got a long head start on your brain
And your heart is afraid
And you don't get to say you're thinking
Come on make it easy now
Come on make it easy on us all
Come on make it easy now or tears may fall
She's got it all worked out I'm afraid
And your time is arranged
And it's strange but you're feeling fine
(She's got it all worked out)
(She's got it all worked out)
(She's got it all worked out)
(She's got it all worked out)
She's got it all worked out I'm afraid
And your life is arranged
And it's strange but you're feeling fineEmbed
