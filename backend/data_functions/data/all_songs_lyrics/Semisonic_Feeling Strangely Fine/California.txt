California LyricsDriven through the canyons I was
Dazzled by the mountains and we, didn't go very far
Close enough to heaven if you
Climb up on a mansion you too can, swing like a star
I tried to get inside
I bought a ticket with my pride
And I was gone right out of my head
I went out for a ride to go
Across a great divide
And I ended up at home instead
California
I thought I should see
Now I'm back home, yeah
With twelve little pieces of me
I was just a passenger
A rider on the tremors
That were shaking all our beds at night
A visitor a stranger thought
I might pass for a regular
If I just kept out of the lights
Tore my heart out from my chest
Mixed it up in my mind
With the best freshest pieces of my soul
Chose the ones I loved the most
Drove 'em all down to the coast
Threw 'em in a big black hole
California
I thought I should see
Now I'm back home, yeah
Got twelve little pieces of me
California
I dreamed I would find
Some kinda sorta pick-me-up
I got twelve little pieces of my mind
California
I thought I should see
Now I'm back home, yeah
Got twelve little pieces of me
California
I dreamed I would find
Some kinda sorta pick-me-up
I got twelve little pieces of my mind
Twelve little pieces of my mind
Twelve little pieces of my mind
Twelve little pieces of my mind, ohhEmbed
