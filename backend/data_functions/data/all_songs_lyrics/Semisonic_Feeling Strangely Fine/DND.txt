DND LyricsDND, now they'll leave us alone
DND, now you turn off the phone
I like you to make the whole world disappear and
I like you to make everything seem so clear and
I like you to make me wanna stay forever
Here, behind your door
DND, hang the sign on the door
DND, don't disturb us no more
I like you to make your love my hideaway and
I like you to make my troubles slide away and
I like you to make me wanna play forever
Here, behind your door
Minute, I got some space and time
I want it to get me back in the crowd
Minute, I got some peace
You found me trying to make my way to the loud
What a clown
DND, leave the hotel at noon
DND, will I see you soon
I like you to make the whole world disappear and
I like you to make everything seem so clear and
I like you to make me wanna stay forever
Here, behind your door
Minute, I got some space and time
I want it to get me back in the crowd
Minute, I got some peace
You found me trying to make my way to the loud
What a clown
DND, DND, DND
Now they'll leave us aloneEmbed
