Made to Last LyricsMade to last awhile, and roll on
Made to move in style, and move along
Made to dream of flying so high
Made to wake up crying, I don't know why
Beautiful one, sleep in the sun
Secret, sweet, and sublime
I hope you last a long, long time
I hope you last a long, long time
Made to come alone and pair off
Flash like a rolling stone, seventy-one
One-time love affair with the earth
Waiting on the air for some rebirth
For what it's worth
Wherever you are, nearby or far
Black, white, lemon or lime
I hope you last a long, long time
I hope you last a long, long time
(Do do doo)
(Do do doo) I hope you last a long, long time
(Do do doo) I hope you last a long, long time
(Do do doo) I hope you last, I hope you last
I hope you last a long, long time, a long, long time
