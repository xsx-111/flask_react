Sadnecessary Lyrics
Mirror, mirror
Who is the happiest?
Is it the lover or
Is it the beloved?
And mirror, mirror
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around?
You shot my heart like a bullet all along
But when you leave me just carry me slow home
Mirror, mirror
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around?

Sadnecessary is what you promised me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow
Is what you promised me
All I can do is to follow
Sadnecessary is what you promised me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow
Is what you promised me
All I can do is to follow
Mirror, mirror
Who is the happiest?
Is it the lover or
Is it the beloved?
And mirror, mirror
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around?
You shot my heart like a bullet all along
But when you leave me just carry me slow home
Mirror, mirror
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around?

Sadnecessary is what you promised me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow
Is what you promised me
All I can do is to follow
Sadnecessary is what you promised me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow
Is what you promised me
All I can do is to follow13Embed
