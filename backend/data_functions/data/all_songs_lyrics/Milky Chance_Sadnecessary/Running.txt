Running Lyrics
I've never been running so far, so immense far
When will I fall into your arms?
I want to try and stand the pain
Of my long-time-hurting-feet
And what about you, you drunken soul
Is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die
Or are you going to give up now?
To give up now?
To give up now?
To give up now?

I've never run so real, so immense real
When will I fall into your heart?
I want to try and stand the pain
Of my long-time-hurting-feet
And what about you, you drunken soul
Is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die
Or are you going to give up now?
I've never run so far, so immense far
When will I fall into your arms?
I want to try and stand the pain
Of my long-time-hurting-feet
And what about you, you drunken soul
Is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die
Or are you going to give up now?

I never been running so far, so immense far
When will I fall into your arms?
I want to break those circle-rules
I want to dance the waltz with you
And what about you, you drunken soul
Is that your own will to go?
On and on until I die
Or are you going to give up now?
To give up now?
To give up now?
To give up now?

(I have never run so real...)
(I have never run so real...)
I've never run so real, so immense real
When will I fall into your heart?
I want to try and stand the pain
Of my long-time-hurting-feet
And what about you, you drunken soul
Is it your own will to go?
On and on until I die
Or are you going to give up now?8Embed
