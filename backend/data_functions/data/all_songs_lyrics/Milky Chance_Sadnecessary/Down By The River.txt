Down By The River Lyrics
Down by the river
I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion
And to the lovers place
I was stucked in a puddle
Full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know
That we've paid unlike

Honey, I know hey
When we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away
The falseness of our past
And I know too
It's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
That's what those lovers do

Down by the river
I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion
And to the lovers place
I was stucked in a puddle
Full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know
That we've paid unlike
Honey, I know hey
When we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away
The falseness of our past
And I know too
It's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
That's what those lovers do
Ohhhouhhh ... down by the river
Ohhhouhhh ... down by the river
Ohhhouhhh ... down by the river
Ohhhouhhh ... down by the river

Down by the river
I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion
And to the lovers place
I was stucked in a puddle
Full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know
That we've paid unlike

Honey, I know hey
When we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away
The falseness of our past
And I know too
It's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
That's what those lovers do
Ohhhouhhh ...27Embed
