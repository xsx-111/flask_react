Stunner Lyrics
She was a stunner
Riding high and I got low
Rank and others
Couldn't see what she was worth
On the party
Behind the sunrise in the meadow
Month of July

I was a runner
Running high without a stop
Sticking to the
Imaginable spire-spot
On the party
Behind the sunrise in the meadow
Month of July

Come, come
We go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
We go so far and we
End up in richest poverty
Go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
And we'll end up
In richest poverty
She was a stunner
Riding high and I got low
Rank and others
Couldn't see what she was worth
On the party
Behind the sunrise in the meadow
Month of July

I was a runner
Running high without a stop
Sticking to the
Imaginable spire-spot
On the party
Behind the sunrise in the meadow
Month of July

Come, come
We go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
We go so far and we
End up in richest poverty
Go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
And we'll end up
In richest poverty
Come, come
We go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
We go so far and we
End up in richest poverty
Go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
And we'll end up
In richest poverty
I was a runner
Running high without a stop
Sticking to the
Imaginable spire-spot
On the party
Behind the sunrise in the meadow
Month of July

Come, come
We go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
And we'll end up
In richest poverty
Go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
And we'll end up
In richest poverty
Come, come
We go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
And we'll end up
In richest poverty
Go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
And we'll end up
In richest poverty
Go up to church
And ring the bell of happiness
And we'll end up
In richest poverty, mhm, yeah
Yeah
End up
End up
In richest poverty8Embed
