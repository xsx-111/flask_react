Sweet Sun Lyrics
Look at you
I am attracted to you like the sun
To the moon that I'll be sweeping when I touch your skin
Take you soaring to the wide open space league
Then we stripped an area so that, that you can see
How we explode like the lights in the dark
And how we glow
Like it will never be the truth of the minds that we forget
So let me tell you what I know if I can
You know I try
I never want to leave the bubble we've made when we create

Mmmm you're my baby
And your sweet sweet sun makes me crazy
Mmmm you're my baby
I want to lay you down and see how you amaze me

You push me up to the inglorious shadows of a craving
And if we fall we blow up like exponential assembly
I never thought that some training can stand your mind from behaving
Did you forget the joy you've reaped and all the times that we made it
We were the pink gold soldiers of the century of blissful
We were 1969
We were Jimi and Janis
We are the prophets of the sails
We choose the way of dimension
We are caught up from the amount of the frenetic love tension
Mmmm you're my baby
And your sweet sweet sun makes me crazy
Mmmm you're my baby
I want to lay you down and see how you amaze me

You push me up to the inglorious shadows of a craving
And if we fall we blow up like exponential assembly
I never thought that some training can stand your mind from behaving
Did you forget the joy you've reaped and all the times that we made it
We were the pink gold soldiers of the century of blissful
We were 1969
We were Jimi and Janis
We are the prophets of the sails
We choose the way of dimension
We are caught up from the amount of the frenetic love tension

Mmmm you're my baby
And your sweet sweet sun makes me crazy
Mmmm you're my baby
I want to lay you down and see how you amaze me12Embed
