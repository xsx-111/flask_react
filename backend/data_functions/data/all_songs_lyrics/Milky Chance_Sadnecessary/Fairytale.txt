Fairytale LyricsYou are a fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are a fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away
We should run away
I can hear them tapping on the ground
Where do we wanna go?
I know an ambush where we won't be found
And so we went to the place, honey
Listening to the all-night-singing-sweet-melodies-fairy trees
And there was no better place to be
And so we took off to the moon
And all the shining lights
In the night
You are a fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are a fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away
You are a fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are a fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away
You are a fairy-tale
Don't you wanna stay?
You are a fairy-tale
I hope that you don't run away
You are a fairy-tale
You are a fairy-tale
You are a fairy-tale
You are a fairy-tale
Hope you gonna stay
You are a fairy-tale
Hope you don't run away10Embed
