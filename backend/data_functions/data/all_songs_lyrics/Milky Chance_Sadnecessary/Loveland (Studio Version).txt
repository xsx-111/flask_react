Loveland (Studio Version) Lyrics
Take me to Loveland
And no one's gonna find me
Cause I'm leaving this old place
I don't care
Nothing's too far
I handle that
Oh trust me
When we're leaving this old place
I don't care
It's like she has flowers in her hair
And you have flowers in your mouth
Cause your heart is upside down
And you get dizzy because of her charisma
She will love you like a twister
You'll be swept away
You'll be swept away

Like we were so so soo so sooo in love
Like we were so so soo so sooo in love

Take me to Loveland
And no one's gonna find me
Cause I'm leaving this old place
I don't care
Nothing's too far
I handle that
Oh trust me
When we're leaving this old place
I don't care
It's like she has flowers in her hair
And you have flowers in your mouth
Cause your heart is upside down
And you get dizzy because of her charisma
She will love you like a twister
You'll be swept away
You'll be swept away
We were so so soo so sooo in love
We were so so soo so sooo in love
And we were so so so so so so so sooo in love
And we were so so so so so so so sooo in loveEmbed
