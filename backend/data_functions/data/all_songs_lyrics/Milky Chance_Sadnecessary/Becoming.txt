Becoming LyricsOnly jealousy is blind
But there's a light that brings me back
It takes me to the right horizon
Takes me where I want to be
Blood is running down the river
I feel like fond of destruction
Is destiny playing a dirty trick on you
When you were not the one you wanted to be
Can't you see the pain inside
Over the years we can hide
How long will you be able to stand yourself
If you think no one is stopping you
Only jealousy is blind
But there's a light that brings me back
It takes me to the right horizon
Takes me where I want to be7Embed
