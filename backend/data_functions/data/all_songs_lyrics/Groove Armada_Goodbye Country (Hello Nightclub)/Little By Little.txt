Little By Little LyricsGive it out, give it out, give it out, give it out
Give it away, give it away
Give it out, give it out, give it away
Today, today, today, today, today, today
Today, today, today, yeah yeah yeah
Perhaps we're on own way
Perhaps we've gone too far
Perhaps we should slow down
Be where we really are, really are, yeah
Today, today if you believe that there is no other way
Trying living, today today little by little in your own way
Today little by little, trying living today
Today little by little
We're in today, today if you believe that there is no other way
Trying living today, today little by little, you're on your own way
Perhaps we're on own way
Perhaps we've gone too far
Perhaps we should slow down
Be where we really are
Where we really are, where we really are
Today, today trying living today, today, today
Little by little trying living today, today, little by little
Be where we really are little by little
Today, today we where we really areEmbed
