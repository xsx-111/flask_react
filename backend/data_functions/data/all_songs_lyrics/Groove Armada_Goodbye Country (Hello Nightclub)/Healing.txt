Healing LyricsTo move across the world (across the world, across the world)
To move across the world (across the world, across the world)
To move across the world, the shows take in the time
Too many broken worlds have fallen from the sky
The dance (?) to (?) ourselves apart
Remaining ever woodcut with the single-quiet heart
To move across the world, the shows take in the time
Too many broken worlds have fallen from the sky
To move across the world (across the world, across the world)
To move across the world (across the world, across the world)
To move across the world (across the world, across the world)
To move across the world (across the world, across the world)Embed
