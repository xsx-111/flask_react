Superstylin LyricsInspiration 
Enter in the dance, plug it in an we begin
Crowd up in the center, they watch be dibidim
Watch the way we drop it in a mix timin'
Rise and amplifyin' when we come in with the swing

Just followin' the back an naturally harmonizin'
Climb into position with synchronized things
Live from out the ghetto, we maximizin'
Sound of the Groove Armada we superstylin'
We superstylin'
We superstylin'

Sometime
Can you feel the pressure does unwind
Sometime
Sometime
Through the day and trough the night
Sometime
Sometime
You can make our pressure does unwind
Sometime
Sometime
It's for your spirit and your mind
Sometime
That's how we drop it on the up on the line
One time lyrics that must stick on your mind
Pop a bass line, I'll go prop and provide
My MC super, I'll go double on the right
Go double on the right

Sometime
Can you feel the pressure does unwind
Sometime
Sometime
Through the day and trough the night
Sometime
Sometime
You can make our pressure does unwind
Sometime
Sometime
It's for your spirit and your mind
Sometime
Home operater make the music play in time
Baby let's recline
Worldwide
Enter in the dance, plug it in an we begin
Crowd up in the center, they watch be dibidim
Watch the way we drop it in a mix timin'
Rise and amplifyin' when we come in with the swing
Just followin' the back an naturally harmonizin'
Climb into position with synchronized things
Live from out the ghetto, we maximizin'
Sound of the Groove Armada we superstylin'
We superstylin'
We superstylin'

Sometime
Can you feel the pressure does unwind
Sometime
Sometime
Through the day and trough the night
Sometime
Sometime
You can make our pressure does unwind
Sometime
Sometime
It's for your spirit and your mind
