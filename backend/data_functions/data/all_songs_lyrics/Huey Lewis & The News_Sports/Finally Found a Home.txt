Finally Found a Home LyricsIt used to make me so fed up
People always asking me
What will you be when you grow up
You're gonna need security
Spent a little time in school
Wishing I was somewhere else
Having fun and acting cool
I just want to be myself
And I finally found a home
Where I'll never be alone
Right here where I belong
And I finally found a home
Here, in a song
Thought I'd finally found the one
Together we would always be
Funny how things come undone
Love's not what it's supposed to be
Now everybody needs a place
Even if it's on a stage
Everybody needs a race
Something to help them turn the page
And I finally found a home
Where I'll never be alone
Right here where I belong
And I finally found a home
Here, in a song
It used to make me so fed up
People always asking me
What are you now that you've grown up
Exactly what I want to beEmbed
