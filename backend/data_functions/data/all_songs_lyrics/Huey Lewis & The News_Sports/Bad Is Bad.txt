Bad Is Bad Lyrics(Ah-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Doo-wop
Ah-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Doo-wop
Ah-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Doo-wop
Ah-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Doo-wop)

Went uptown
To see my cousin
Plays his guitar
Sounds like a chainsaw buzzin'
In the crowd
I see his mom and dad
I say, "Hey, hey Uncle
Man, your son is bad"

Sometimes (sometimes)
Sometimes bad is bad
(Aah, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit
Doo wop, wop)
Cool is a rule, but
Sometimes bad is bad
(Aah, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit)
Across the street
A neon sign
All you can eat for a
Dollar ninety nine
Our soul stew
Is the baddest in the land
But-a one dollar's worth
Was all that I could stand

Sometimes (Sometimes)
Sometimes bad is bad
Aah, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit
Doo wop, wop
I say cool is a rule, but
Sometimes, bad is bad
Ow!
(Aah-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Aah-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Aah-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit
Aah-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit-dit)
Back uptown
To see Marie
Nobody home
I opened the door with my key
"I love you, Huey"
Was the note I read
But there's a strange pair of shoes
Underneath the bed

Sometimes
Sometimes bad is bad
Aah, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit
Doo wop, wop
I say cool is a rule, but
Sometimes, bad is bad
(Aah, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit
Doo wop, wop)
I say cool is a rule, but
Sometimes, bad is bad
Aah, dit, dit, dit, dit, dit
Doo wop, wop
I say cool is a rule, but
(Cool a rule)
Sometimes bad is bad
