Walking on a Thin Line (Session Take) LyricsSometimes in my bed at night
I curse the dark and I pray for light
And sometimes, the light's no consolation
Blinded by a memory
Afraid of what it might do to me
And the tears and the sweat
Only mock my desperation
Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for?
Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city
Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me
Taught me how to shoot to kill
A specialist with a deadly skill
A skill I needed to have to be a survivor
It's over now or so they say
Well, sometimes, it don't work out that way
'Cause you're never the same
When you've been under fire, no
Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for?
Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city
Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's done to me
Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for, no
Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city
Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me
Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin lineEmbed
