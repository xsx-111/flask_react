You Crack Me Up Lyrics
Oh my god, I can't believe my eyes
Underneath that ghostly pale, is that you?
Someone in your shape shouldn't be driving
Someone in your shape shouldn't be doing anything at all
You should see yourself in the mirror
With your leather lips and your snakeskin shoes
Do you have to shout in my ear?
Do me a favor, just stop talking for a minute or two

You crack me up, you really, really do
With your sunglasses on, acting so young
Only I know what you're really up to
You break me up

No, I don't wanna sit in your sports car
No, I don't wanna hear a tune
All the locals say you'll go far
What's so funny, they don't know you like I do

You crack me up, you twisted wreck
Shouting in the parking lot, gonna give it one more shot
Better hope they'll cash a check
You break me up

You better ask yourself a question
'Cause you can't live like this for long
You better listen to my suggestion
Before you wind up in somebody else's song

You crack me up, you really, really do
With your sunglasses on, acting so young
Only I know what you're really up to
You break me up

You crack me up, you break me up
You crack me up, you break me up
You crack me upEmbed
