10th Ave. Freezeout LyricsTear drops on the city
Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Whole world walking pretty
But you can't find the room to move
Everybody better move over, that's all
Running on the bad side
I got my back to the wall
Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Stranded in the jungle
Trying to take all the heat they was giving
Night is dark but sidewalks bright
And lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walk into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out
When the change was made uptown
And the big man he joined the band
From the coastline to the city
All the little babies raise their hands
Gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the big man bust this city in half
With a Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-outEmbed
