No More Beatle Mania LyricsNo more Beatle mania
Once is enough
There's better ways
To put down Studio 54
Once is enough
Say "no"
To new Beatle mania
Once is enough
Put down disco
With new wave bands
Once is enough
We will not buy your records
Now
Once is enough
Don't buy new Beatle records
When
Once is enough
Don't let them sell you
Old-fashioned mania
Once is enough
When you could have
Yoko mania
Once is enough
Or you could have
Talking Heads mania
Once is enough
Or you could have
Shaggs mania
Once is enough
Once is enough
Once is enough
Once is enough
Once is enough
Once is enough
Once is enough
Once is enough1Embed
