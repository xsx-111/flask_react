I Love Oriental Girls LyricsI love oriental girls
In fact
I like a million different kinds of girls
Do you love me, little French girl?
"Oui, oui"
Do you love me, little Chicano girl?
"Sí, sí"
What's your name, little French girl?
"Fee Fee"
What's your name, little Chicano girl?
"Chi Chi"
I love oriental girls
I love their pretty face
That looks like a painting
I would take their picture
And sell it to the Museum of Modern Art
I love oriental girls
In Japan
And China
And Chinatown, San Francisco, California
I love you
Oriental girls
