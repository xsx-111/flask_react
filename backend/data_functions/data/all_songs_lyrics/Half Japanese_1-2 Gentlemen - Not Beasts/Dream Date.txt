Dream Date LyricsI don't want a dumb date
I just want a dream date
Maybe I'm fussy, I don't know
But I don't want some girl
Who smokes all the time
And when I kiss her
It tastes like I'm licking an ash tray
I want a dream date
I love a dream date
I don't like crabby girls
Because they're full of shit
I like pretty girls
And I want you to
Hope that you will
Wish you would be
Hope you will be my
I want you to
Be my dream date
Tonight
You're so cool
I hope you will be my dream date
