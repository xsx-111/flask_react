Ann Arbor, MI. LyricsKiss me now
And if you want to later on
We'll open the window
And put the speakers by the window
And put on Springsteen
And wake up Ann Arbor
And we'll tell everyone on Hill Street
And we'll tell everyone on State Street
And we'll tell everyone on Shakin' Street
And we'll tell everyone on Love Street
We'll tell about a real love
In Ann Arbor, Michigan
I'm talking about
Real
LoveEmbed
