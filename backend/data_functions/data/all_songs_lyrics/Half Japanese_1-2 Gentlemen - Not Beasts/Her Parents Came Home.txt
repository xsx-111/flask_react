Her Parents Came Home LyricsThe party was B.Y.O
So I B.M.O
I want to get loose
And have some fun
I want to put on a record
And turn it up loud
And dance all night
When her parents are out of town
Her parents came home
And they were pissed
Your mother says
I'm not right for you
Your father says
I'm not right for you
But I say
I'm perfect for youEmbed
