No Direct Line from My Brain to My Heart LyricsMy heart doesn't know
You're already in love
My brain couldn't tell
My heart to control
I might be stupid
But I fell in love with you
Ah, what can I do
Ah, what can I do
No line from my heart to my brain
My heart doesn't know
You're already in love
Ah, what can I do
Ah, what can I do
Ah, what can I do
Ah, what can I do
Ah, what can I do
Ah, what can I do1Embed
