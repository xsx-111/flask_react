School of Love LyricsI met a girl, I said:
"Hey baby, I'm a genius
Why don't you kiss my lips?"
But she was dumb
And didn't kiss my lips
She flunked test number 1
I said:
"I'm smart, why don't you be smart
And we'll make out?"
But she didn't put out
And we didn't make out
She flunked test number 2
I said:
"Why don't you be cool and get hot?"
She said, "No"
I said:
"I'm sorry pretty little girl
But you flunked test number 3
And you cannot graduate from
My school of love."Embed
