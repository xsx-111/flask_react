Bogue Millionaires / Cool Millionaires LyricsI'm not going to hang around
Bogue millionaires no more
No, I'm not going to hang around
Bogue millionaires no more
A bogue millionaire
She won't take you out to dinner
A bogue millionaire
She won't ever buy you a present
Even if it's your birthday
She don't care
That's a bogue millionaire
I'm not going to hang around
One of them
I'm going to hang around
Cool millionaires
And have a cool time
I'm going to go over to
Paloma Picasso's house
And sit on her sofa
And she'll cook dinner for me
And then I'll ask to kiss her
And then I will kiss her
Yeah, I'm going to have a cool time
With my cool millionaire friends
And then I'm going to go to
Dolly Parton's house
And ask her to go on a picnic
And then we'll go in the woods
And she'll sing for me
And she'll put money in
My bank account
Yeah, I'm going to have a cool time
And then I'll go over to
Andy Warhol's house
Because he's one of my best friends
And we'll sit around and watch TV
Yeah, I'm going to have a cool time
With all my cool millionaire friends
And then I'm going to go over to
Margaux Hemingway's house
And just look at her
Ooh, oooh
I'm going to have a cool time
I'm going to have a real cool time
Tonight
And then I'm going to go to
Peter Townshend's house
And we'll have a jam session
And then I'll break his guitar
And knock over his amp
Because I'm a good friend of his
And he's a good friend of mine
Yeah, I'm going to have a
Real cool time
TonightEmbed
