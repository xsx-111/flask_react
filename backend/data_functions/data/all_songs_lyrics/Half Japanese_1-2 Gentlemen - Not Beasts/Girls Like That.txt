Girls Like That LyricsIt's too strong
Emotionally
I don't know what to do
I say like ummm, you know
Too much
Like I'm not myself
You know, around girls like myself
I'm just too weak
Emotionally
I know what I should do
Be really really strong
And be perfect
Because girls like that
I guess all I can do is
Try my best
Try try try
Because girls like that
Like that
And I'm a boy
And boys like that real goodEmbed
