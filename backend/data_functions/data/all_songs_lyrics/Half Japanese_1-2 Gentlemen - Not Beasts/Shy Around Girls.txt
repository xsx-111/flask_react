Shy Around Girls LyricsMaybe it's my brain
I don't know
Maybe my heart beats too fast
I'm shy around girls
Maybe I'll give my heart a test
Heart test
I like to look at your picture
And think about you
I'd like to ask you for a date
Heart test
Test case
Can't
Because I'm shy around girls
But you could call me up
I'll be waiting by the telephone
I'm going to quit school
So I can spend more time
Looking at your picture
And thinking about you
Call me up
And give my heart a test
We can check out my brain
And test my heart
And test my love
And test my passion
And test my emotions
And test my feelings
And test my loveEmbed
