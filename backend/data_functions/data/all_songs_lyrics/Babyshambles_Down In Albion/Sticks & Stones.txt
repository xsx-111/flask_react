Sticks & Stones LyricsThere's a tale
Tale I will tell
Bloodlust, theft, and all cups of tea
And the very, many thing I do so well
Oh I will begin right at the end
That's the end so far away down
They said that I was as good as dead
And there was hope, but not for us together
My friend, my only friend
I will begin right at the end
At the end so far away down
Schizoid, fame on the run
Don't look back into the motherfucking sun, no, no, no
You know when that's the end
And that's the end so far away down
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
Oh but your words
They really hurt me
I will begin it in the end
And that's the end so far away

Sticks and stones may break my bones
Sticks and stones may break my bones
And we'll begin right at the end
And we'll begin right at the end
That's the end so far away so down
At the end
There'll never be an end
Never never be an endEmbed
