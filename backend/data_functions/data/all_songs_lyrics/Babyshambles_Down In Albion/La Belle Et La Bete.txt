La Belle Et La Bete LyricsI'd tell you a story but you won't listen
It's about a nightmare steeped in tradition
It's the story of a coked-up pansy
Who spends his nights in flights of fancy
Met two fellas over Gin and mixers
They talked for a while and soon got the picture
One was a souped up Soho mincer
And the other was a pikey with a knowledge for scripture
Then the conversation turned evil
(Evil)
Talked, talked and talked about people
Why did you do it to so many people?
Stumble left out of the boozer
Threw some shrapnel to the legless fusilier
An endless ceiling and another light
With a half-tenner smile and you're looking alright
That girl's out, way ahead of the game
Way ahead of the game
Way ahead of the game
You've turned your back upon her
One too many times
Spent all her hard earned money
Getting high she sang
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful
Is she more beautiful than me?
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful
Is she more beautiful than me?
She's La Belle Et La Bete at the ball
La Belle Et La Bete at the ball
La Belle Et La Bete at the ball
You know she could have us all
You've turned your back upon her
One too many times
Spent all her hard earned money
Just getting high, she sang
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful
Is she more beautiful than me?
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful
Is she more beautiful than me?
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful
Is she more beautiful than she?
I'll tell you a story but you won't listen
It's about a nightmare steeped in tradition
It's the story of a coked-up pansy
Who spends his nights in flights of fancy
Met two fellas over Gin and mixers
They talked for a while and soon got the picture
One was a souped up Soho mincer
And the other was a pikey with a knowledge for scriptures
Then the conversation turned evil
(Evil)
Talked and talked and talked about people
Why did you do it to so many people?
That girl's out, way ahead of the game
Way ahead of the game
Way ahead of the game
Out, way ahead of the game
You've turned your back upon her
One too many times
Spent all her hard earned money
Just getting high, she sang
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful
Is she more beautiful than me?
Is she more beautiful, is she more beautiful
Is she more beautiful than me?Embed
