What Katy Did Next LyricsThere's a lesson I have learnt
If you play with fire you will get burnt
Hell hath no fury
Like woman scorned
I'll tell you my story
Make you wish you never, wish you...
Wish you never never, wish you never been born
I may never learn, never know
I may live and learn but never know
I may crash and burn, oh no
I may take my turn
If you love her, then tell her you love her and
You could be kissing her soon
If you need her, oh, tell her you need her and
You won't be missing her soon
Oh, but for a love to be true
It must come from her too
It's a lesson hard learned
If you play with fire you will get burnt
Hell hath no fury
... (?)
Oh, I may never learn, you never know
I may live and learn, never know
I may crash and burn, oh no
I may take my turn
If you love her, then tell her you love her and
You could be kissing her soon
If you need her, oh, tell her you need her and
You won't be missing her soonEmbed
