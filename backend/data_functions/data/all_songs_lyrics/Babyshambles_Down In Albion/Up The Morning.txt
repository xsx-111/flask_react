Up The Morning LyricsUp the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Everytime I see your face
It makes me sigh, it makes me trace
Lace shadows of blood on the wall
Not to the landlord's taste, I know
But everytime I see your face
It makes me cry,  it makes me
Unintelligible
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning
Up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
And if I, if I could go
Back in time
And if I, if I could go
Back in time
I'd go to the show where I did not show
And I would not show
Unintelligible
Well what was I supposed to
What was I supposed to
What was I supposed to
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morning
Up the morning, up, up the morningEmbed
