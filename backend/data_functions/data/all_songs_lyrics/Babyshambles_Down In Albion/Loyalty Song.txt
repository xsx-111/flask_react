Loyalty Song LyricsWhat did I dream?
Is nothing's as it seems
On the way back down, for me
What did I dream?
Cause nothing's as it seems
On the way back round, for me
Nothing's gonna keep me from my
What did I dream?
No one's gonna keep me from my
What did I dream?
We're on the one road
Maybe the wrong road
It's the road to fuck knows where
We're on the one road
Maybe the wrong road
But we're together now so I don't care
And there's nothing's gonna keep me from my
What did I dream?
No one's gonna keep me from my
No one'll fucking keep me from my
No one can keep me from my
What did I dream?
What did I dream?
And if I confide in you today
I know you don't believe a single word I say
I found solace in the flood
And everybody knew that I would
Cause I'm alright
And there's a slight crack in my chimney
Now tell me
What did I dream? (x3)
Nothing's as it seems
On the way back round for me
What did I? (x3)
What did I dream?Embed
