Merry Go Round LyricsYou have always thinking of her
You're in love and you don't know what to say
Well I saw her at the fair and she feels the same way
She was merried by the merry-go-round
The merry-go-round
How merrily we go round
How merrily we go round
The merry-go-round
He was the first one of the day
He was the last one of the night
Oh hold me tight, hold me tight
They said you were wrongened
But I can see in your eyes
How you are gentle and wise
And you had the good stuff
Oh there's a parade of girls outside
That boy's so shy
Why'd you punch out his lights?
He was the first one of the day
He was the last one of the night
Oh mop it up, she'll be alright
Mop it up, she'll be alright
There's a parade on the hall outside
Come on and feel the air outside
Said what I like most about you Pete is your girlfriend and your shoes
At half past five we'll swap again half past five then we swap again
There's a parade of girls outside
The boy is so shy why d'you punch out his lights?
You should get some sun on your face we've been sitting like a lord in the bath for days
It's getting so I dont even know you
We get away with doing the little that we can
But we mustn't take it too far my friend
The Albion needs every man woman and child she can get her hands on
He was the first one of the day
He was the last one of the night
Oh hold me tight, hold me tight
They said you were a wrong 'un
But I can see in your eyes
How you are gentle and wise
And you had the good stuff
And there's a parade of girls outside
I've been so good to that boy, why did he steal all my lighters?Embed
