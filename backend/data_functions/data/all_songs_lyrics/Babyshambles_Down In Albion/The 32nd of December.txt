The 32nd of December LyricsSpeak
Don't talk about it
Still
Don't want to know all about it
Arguing with you's no good
Well you'll be nobody's fool but your own
Speak
Don't talk about it
Don't talk about the 32nd of December
That's a night I'm trying so hard to forget
All you do is you come round and then, well I remember
Remember what I try, that I, what I
Speak
Don't talk about it
Still
Don't want to know all about it
Anybody want tea?
Did anybody thank you?
Oh fuck me but don't speak
And don't talk about it
Don't you talk about the 32nd of December
That's a night I'm trying so hard to forget
All you do is you phone, then I, I remember
Remember what I try
That I, what I
Speak
Don't want to talk about it
Well it was you, not I
Who was, such a stickler for manners
So don't you say goodbye
Ah no to your good old friend
Ah goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye

Speak
Don't talk about it
Still
Don't want to know about it
If they ask me nicely then I'll go
But they never do
So I never doEmbed
