In Love With A Feeling LyricsThey would if they could, but they can't
So they're right to talk like they could, or can't
Are you going to heed a word they say
All I'm trying to say was
I'm in love with a feeling
I know that it shows
Yes I'm in love with a feeling
And I don't care who knows
There's a very odd man over there
I don't mean to alarm you
He's by the stairs
No I don't mean to alarm you
He's swimming around all over town
Lost all the meaning, no feeling
Are you going to heed a word they say
No, all I try to say was
I'm in love with a feeling
I know that it shows
I'm in love with a feeling
And I don't care who knows
There's a very odd man over there
I don't mean to alarm you
He's by the stairs
I dont meant to alarm you
I'm still waiting for you to show me fire
Oh how's your fever
Like an open book
Oh you could read me
Ohhh la la la la la
Yes they would if they could, but they can't
So if they talk like they could
Are you going to listen to a word they say
All I'm trying to to say is
I'm in love with a feeling
I know that it shows
I'm in love with a feeling
And I don't care who knows
Because of his hob knob
Ohh la la, I think love was a dirty word
Love all the time
Only in a friendly way
Not too friendly, not too friendlyEmbed
