Pentonville LyricsIndochina man down from Vietnam
And all the people from the Caribbean
English, Scottish and Irish man
We just come together and sing this a one
Call man and woman, black and white
Banned to survival have to put up a fight, so
A wing, B wing, C wing and G Wing
Come help I sing
A wing, B wing, C wing and D Wing
Come help I sing
It's rough
It's wicked and rough
It's hard
Pentonville rough
It's tough
It's wicked and rough
It's hard
Pentonville rough
Now in Pentonville there's all type of nation
Russian, Columbian and Jamaican
Latvian, Croatian and a Polishman
Indian, Chinaman down from Vietnam
And from the Carribbean an Jamaican
Poorly paid people formed the Irish gang
And the Scottish and the Englishman
They're rough
Pentonville tough
It's hard
Wicked and rough
Yeah rough
Pentonville tough
It's hard
Wicked and rough now
Everyday, it's the same
People can't get better
No they can't get tamed
And black up the heads of the sick and the lame
Some men jump out of their brains
Cause they can't take the pressure
Or the shame or the pain
When they see the life, it go down the drain
In Pentonville it's a different ball game
It's rough
Pentonville tough
It's hard
Wicked and rough
Yeah rough
Pentonville tough
It's hard
Wicked and rough now
Lying on my lumpy mattress
Lying on my back
Staring up at the ceiling
Counting all the cracks
And what's happening behind me
Look over my shoulder back
Bill Cole got my breakfast pack
He won't give it back
Ooooooooooh
It's rough
Pentonville tough
It's hard
Wicked and rough
Yeah rough
Pentonville tough
It's hard
Wicked and rough now
Everyday, it's the same
People can't get better
No they can't get tamed
And black up the heads of the sick and the lame
Some men jump out of their brains
Cause they can't take the pressure
Or the shame or the pain
When they see the life, it go down the drain
In Pentonville it's a different ball game
So A wing, B wing, C wing and G Wing
Come help us sing
A wing, B wing, C wing and G Wing
Come help us sing
Because it's rough
Pentonville tough
It's hard
Wicked and rough
Yeah tough
Pentonville rough
It's hard
Wicked and roughEmbed
