Back From the Dead LyricsI heard it said
You had come back from the dead
You were playing so fine
Scooping up the soul of the wine
Courage my boy, when you look them in the eye
Try not to look too scummy
If you want some money
If you need some money now, oh
This ain't no happy place to be
There's nothing nice around me
Nothing nice about me
Oh almost everyone agrees
It's a hell of a year for you and me my friend
Oh promises, promises
I know you've heard them all before
Love is, love is, love is, love is, love is
Oh well it's just around the corner
I heard it said
You had come back from the dead
Playing so fine
Even if you don't show up on time
Courage my boy
The way you look them in the eye
Laugh if they try to be funny
If you need some money now, oh
