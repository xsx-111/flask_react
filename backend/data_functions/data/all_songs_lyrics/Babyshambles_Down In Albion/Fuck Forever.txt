Fuck Forever Lyrics
It's one and the same, one and the same, oh
So what's the use between death and glory?
I can't tell between death and glory?
Happy endings, no, they'll never bored me
Happy endings, they still don't bore me
But they, they have a way
A way to make you pay
And to make you toe the line

Let's sever the ties
Because I'm so clever
But clever ain't wise

And fuck forever
If you don't mind
Oh, fuck forever
If you don't mind, don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind

Oh, what's the use between death and glory?
I can't tell between death and glory
New labour and Tory
Purgatory and no happy families
It's one and the same, one and the same
No, it's not the same, it's not supposed to be the same
You know about that way
The way they make you pay
And the way they make you toe the line
I severed my ties
Oh, I'm so clever
You're so clever but you're not very nice

So fuck forever
If you don't mind
Oh, I'm stuck forever
In your mind, your mind, your mind

Go ahead and know about that way
To make you feel like shit and make you pay
And to make you toe the line, line

I sever my tie
Oh, and I'll never
Sever the ties

And fuck forever
If you don't mind
See, I'm stuck forever
Oh, I'm stuck in your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Oh, they'll never play this on the radio
Oh, they'll never play this on the radio1Embed
