8 Dead Boys Lyrics8 dead boys sittin' on the wall...
Sit right down if you're a friend
You know there ain't too many left of them
Who said I want love, I want it all
Well, you look better now than last time
But you still look better from afar
The life that you wanted was not in store
You're gonna be in the dark once again
My love
Hello, Hello
Hello, my Love
Hello, my Love
Stop your moaning and I'll give you a taster
They'll give you a line, and then call you a waster
So don't!
You say you will or you won't
Either you do or you don't
Do or you don't
Do or you don't
Cause you look better now than the last time
But you're still no better than before
The life that you wanted was not in store
You're gonna be in the dark once again
My love
My love
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
When it suits you, you're a friend of mine
A friend of mine
A friend of mine
A friend of mine
A friend of mine (mine)
Cause you look better now than the last time
Still no better than before
The life that you wanted was not in store
You're gonna in the dark once again
You look better now than the last time
But you still look better from afar
The life that you wanted was not in store
You're gonna be in the dark once again
Hello, my loveEmbed
