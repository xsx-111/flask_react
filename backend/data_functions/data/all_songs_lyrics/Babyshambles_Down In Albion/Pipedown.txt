Pipedown LyricsOh Patty put the pipe down
If you've got the right sound
If it's not right son
Neither am I, oh my oh my
Do your sums
Work out a fairer way
If it comes undone
Just paper over the cracks
And there ain't no turning back
Oh on The Sun
They make you out to be a tearaway
Comes undone
Ahh I just spoke to Matt
Pat, they want the money back
Oh put the pipe down
If you've got the right sound
If it's the right sound
Oh my, oh my
Do your sums
Work out a fairer way
Can you play No Fun
Oh what d'you think of that
Cause they want it back
You better pipe down
You got the right sound
Put the pipe down
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Na na-na na-na...
Oh Patty put the pipe down
If you've got the right sound
If it's not right son
Neither am I, oh my oh my
Oh Paddy put the pipe down
If you've got the right sound
If it's the right sound
Oh my, oh my, oh myEmbed
