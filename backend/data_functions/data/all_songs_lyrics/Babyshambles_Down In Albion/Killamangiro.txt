Killamangiro LyricsWhy would you pay to see me in a cage?
And why would you pay to see me in a cage?
Some men call a stage
Listen now I have gone
You will know
I was the only one that'd have gladly died
For what was wrong in the eyes of the unwell and unwise
And they killed a man for his giro today
Wasn't very gay, I didn't mind
I wasn't money mad anyway
They killed a man for his giro today
Why, would you pay?
Why, would you pay?
To see me in a cage
It's all across the stage
And know
When the night has come
You might say
I was not the only the one who would've died
What was wrong in the eyes of the cruel and unwise
As they killed a man for his giro today
On the off chance that you're listening
To the radio
I thought you might like to know you broke my heart
Can only  on or hedge your bets
On a second chance I'll never get again
All my ties, time and time
I keep on trying hard not to try too hard
And I forgive but I won't forget
To killing time, so I'm better now
Don't need it any more
Anything that makes you feel hate
Can do without hate
Now I believe in love
Now I have gone
Oh yeah, I will pay
For everything you've done
What was wrong
In the eyes of the unwell and unwise
They killed a man for his giro todayEmbed
