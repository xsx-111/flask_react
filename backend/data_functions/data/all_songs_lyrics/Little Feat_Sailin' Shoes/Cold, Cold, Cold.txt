Cold, Cold, Cold LyricsCold, cold, cold
Cold, cold, cold
Freezing ... it was freezing cold
In that hotel
Well, I had no money
My special friend was gone
TV set was busted
So she went along
I called Room... Room Service
"I'm down here on my knees
A peach, or a pear, or a coconut please"
But they was cold
Well it's been a month since I seen my girl
Or a dime to make the call
'Cause it passed me up, or it passed me by
Or I couldn't decide at all
Mixed up, I'm so mixed up
Don't you know I'm lonely
And I wish the world would get off of my case
And get on one of its own
Cold, cold, cold
Cold, cold, cold
That woman was freezing, freezing cold
I tried everything to warm her up
But I'm living in this cold hotel
Well, she passed me up, or she passed me by
I couldn't decide at all
Mixed up, I'm so mixed up
Don't you know I'm lonely
All the things I hadda do
I had to fall in love
You know, it's cold
Turn the clock back, woman, when you see me
Coming 'round
My feet don't even, don't even
Touch the ground
Don't be cold, don't be cold
Don't be cold, don't be coldEmbed
