Cat Fever LyricsLivin' in strange dreams
Takin' prescribed medication
Where will i take me, where will it take me
My vision's all marred by a careless
Chance visit on the part of me
Cat fever, I got cat fever
My breathin is harder sittin in back of the theatre
When will he make
Forgot about fixin the leak in my faucet
What come over me
I'll let my dogs loose prayin' that they
Will protect me
Give me a bullet, one silver bullet
I won't let them get me 'cause those
Demon figures are after me
Cat fever, I got cat feverEmbed
