Got No Shadow LyricsTake yourself you who love no one else
I can see all that's changing
It ain't so hard smooth as you like it
When you like when you like
It all takes time but
When you know it's work it
You keep your dreams it may be dark tonight
Tomorrow dark to light
It's up to you and me
It could start tonight
Take your life I know you been longing for
Some good dreams good dreams well it's
All right smooth as you like it
When you like when you like
Got no shadow living in the closet with me
You once traveling lonely
Got no shadow living in the closet with me
Making room for you and you for meEmbed
