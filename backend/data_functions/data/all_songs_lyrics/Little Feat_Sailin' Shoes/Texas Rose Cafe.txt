Texas Rose Cafe LyricsPicked up on my phone in Houston
Everybody answered, everybody answered but they won't say why
Then this dancer grabbed me down by the bus stop
And she said I'm takin' you with me to the Texas Rose cafe
I got a fast car, it's a jaguar, and I'll get you to the plane on time
Drinkin' Lone Star, play guitar, we'll have a real good time
I said love to be found in Austin
Love to be found in Austin town
I replied that I would try, but you see my time is not my own
'Cause when I was just a big time low ball fool
My friend Leroy came to me
He said look out your window
Does the first man you see look like me?
I'm sooooore displeased
Since that time I changed my mind
About the things I'm up to
Yet the things around me stay just the same
'Cause outside my hotel window is a sign that turns from red to green
It says chop suey and join the U.S. MarinesEmbed
