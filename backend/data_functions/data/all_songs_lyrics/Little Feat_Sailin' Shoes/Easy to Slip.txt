Easy to Slip LyricsIt's so easy to slip
It's so easy to fall
And let your memory drift
And do nothin' at all
All the love that you missed
All the people that you can't recall
Do they really exist at all?
Well, my whole world seems so cold today
All the magics's gone away
And our time together melts away
Like the sad melody I play
Well, I don't want to drift forever
In the shadow of your leaving me
So I'll light another cigarette
And try to remember to forget
It's so easy to slip
It's so easy to fall
And let your memory drift
And do nothin' at all
All the love that you missed
All the people that you can't recall
Do they really exist at all?Embed
