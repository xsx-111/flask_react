Tripe Face Boogie LyricsWell I was buffalo-ed in Buffalo
And I was entertained in Houston
New York, New York you gotta choose one
It's a tripe face boogie
Going to boogie my sneakers away yeah yeah
Well I, I don't want your money
And I don't want your time
Please don't jive me Honey
And I'll give you, give you back your dime
It's a hype face boogie
Going to boogie my sneakers away yeah
I don't dig potato chips
And I can't take torts (?)
Got to tripe my guacamole baby
It's quackers and tripe my sauce
It's a hype face boogie
Going to boogie my scruples away yeah
Hype boogie, hype boogie
All night long...
You bring your guitar
I'll bring the wine
Gonna tripe my guacamole baby
Just a one more time
It's a hype face boogie
And I say 'lookout'!Embed
