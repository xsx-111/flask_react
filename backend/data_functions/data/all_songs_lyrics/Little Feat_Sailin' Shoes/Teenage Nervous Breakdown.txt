Teenage Nervous Breakdown LyricsIs bad for the the body and bad for the soul
Bad for the heart, bad for the mind
Bad for the deaf, and bad for the blind
Makes some men crazy and then they act like fools
Makes some men crazy, and then they start to drool
Unscrupulous operators could confuse
Could exploit and deceive
Conditional reflex theories and changing probabilities
It's a crass and raucous crackass place
It's a plague upon the the human race
It's a terrible illness, it's a terrible case
And it's usually permanent when it takes place
It's a teenage nervouse breakdown
It's a teenage nervouse breakdownEmbed
