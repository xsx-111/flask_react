Hush LyricsGo to sleep and hush little darling
It's time for bed, time to put out the light
Sweet dreams are awaiting behind your closed eyes
And a blanket of night
Where the bed bugs don't bite
Go to sleep and hush until morning
You've said all your prayers
Time to make them come true
Don't worry your daddy is here
If you need him tonight
Ease your mind
Rest your eyes and sleep tight
GoodnightEmbed
