The Ghost at Number One Lyrics
Ugly apparition
God's gift to oxygen, the puffed-up immortal son
How they love him cause he'll become
The ghost at number one

(How does it feel)
To be the only one?
(How does it feel)
To be the only one that knows that you're right?
(How does it feel)
To be a loaded gun?
(How does it feel)
Inside a chamber packed with piss and spite?

Sure life's no cherry but a cupcake for the meek (shootupbopbop)
So he shoots up his poison until the frosting tastes so sweet
(Like a valenti-i-ine)
Yeah, he's giving it all he's got, the king of rebels hit the jackpot
But his finish line was an artistic flop
And even the critics can't outrun
The ghost at number one

(How does it feel)
To be the only one?
(How does it feel)
To be the only one that knows that you're right?
(How does it feel)
To be a chalkline dollar sign
(How does it feel)
Up at the address all the widows write?
Mrs. Lynn, the fruit of your labor
Gives us a savior
Nappy superstar
To you we bid congratulations
To him adulation
A blessed life begun...
For the ghost at number one!

(How does it feel)
To be the only one?
(How does it feel)
To be the only one that knows that you're right?
(How does it feel)
To be a visionary poet?
(How does it feel)
To pack a pen with vinegar and insight?

(There's a party at the pearly gates of gold and platinum)
To be the only one
(For you, an invitation to the holy rock-n-rollers)
To be the only one that knows that you're right
(Standin' on the bandstand, you'll see the legends)
To be a so deep down underground
(Who'll tell you how it feels to be the only one who knows)
To be the only one who knows you've been buried alive
Mrs Lynn, the fruit of your labor
Gives us a savior
Mrs. Lynn, the fruit of your labor
Gives us a savior...1Embed
