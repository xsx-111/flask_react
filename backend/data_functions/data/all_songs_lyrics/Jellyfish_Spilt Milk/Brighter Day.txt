Brighter Day LyricsStrike the tent
Unpop the paintbox
And pack the carriages
With the flesh freaks of fear
At the beach
We left them shell shocked
Lining up the avenue
In view of next year
High steppin'
Like a brigade
Down the block
Don't be shocked
To hear somebody say "wake up doomsday"
It's time to join the big parade
Come and march in time with the band
Playing loud fighting crowds
To see the matinee (it's tailor made)
Because it's gonna be a brighter day
(Ladies and gentlemen)
For the seeker of thrills
Behind the ferris wheels
There's a man with one foot in the
Grave and one foot on a
Banana peel
He's an actor of sorts
Who sold himself too short
So now he travels door to door
Performing 'death of a salesman'
Oh my country tears of thee
How the circus makes the world
Safe for anarchy
In a cage with an uneasy chair
Atop a merry go round
(Atop a merry go round)
He wears that clown crown
Can't you see that you can
Come as you are
As you were
If you prefer you can change
(yes it can be arranged)
Oh, when you come and join the big parade
But you can leave your bagage
At home don't you pack
Don't look back
Then you can truly say
'goodbye highway'
That what then and this is nowadays
Come on you big shot enjoy the rain
Take a class in pumping blood into those weather veins
And I bet you'd still come out as teacher's pet
Cause when it comes to being watertight
(I scream and you scream, you'll always be a plumber with a pipe dream)
You wrote that book you own the copyright and clown costume
I saw it hanging in the closet of your elbow room
Come and join the big parade
It's going to be brighter day
If you've had it up to here with what's real
I'm here to tell you that it's no big deal
Because it's not too late
If you hurry up you can
Come on and join the big charade
Line up shut up clean up and shave
Cause right behind you in the back of the fray
Is a blade he's a renegade
Turning bullshit into marmalade
Don't you know there's gonna be
A heavy price to pay
For pushing all these clouds away
It's bound to be a brighter day
It can't help but be a brighter dayEmbed
