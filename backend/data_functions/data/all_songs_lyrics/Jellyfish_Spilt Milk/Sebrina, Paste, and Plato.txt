Sebrina, Paste, and Plato LyricsFar behind the forest of flying paper airplanes
Grazing on the grounds of ponytails
The substitute is counting down her ticks 'til recess
Hammering down to size her fingernails
Because today's the day Sebrina builds her box lunch buffet
Kool-aid, sandwiches and chips for all the shoulders
Lunch is on the table
Soon dessert is on the floor
Singing
So serene
Sebrina makes me feel so serene
So serene
Sebrina makes me feel so serene
Chesney's looking dapper in his brand new dunce cap
Strolling down the runway to an "F"
(never has he ever looked as lovely)
With all the others watching
Eating paste and plato (the one and only)
He fights the urge to run and kiss the chef
But she's a lovetarian especially in the form of puppies
So he keeps his elbows off her table but spills the beans
That he loves the girl behind the boysenberry punch
(Sebrina)
So serene
Sebrina makes me feel so serene
(Our lady of the jabberwock)
So serene
Sebrina makes me feel so serene
(I live to smell her tulips talk)
So serene
Sebrina makes me feel so serene
(Hostess for the show and tell, the shepherdess of the muscatel flock)
Lunchbox, hopscotch on the rocks
With spitballs, pratfalls, alcohol
Sebrina...Embed
