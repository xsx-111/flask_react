New Mistake LyricsCurtain opens, spotlights the gentleman
Signing his love letter "Best wishes, Simpleton"
Dialog swam from his pen like pollywogs
He knew better that perfume was gravity
Pulling him closer to what could be tragedy
Love is blind, deaf and dumb, but never mind
You better catch me when I fall
I'm on my roller skates
Cause any ol' way that I fall
I land in your arms even though it's wrong
Cause I love my new mistake
Intermission gave way to a miracle
The birth of an accident grew to a spectacle
That couldn't wait
The mother was three weeks late
So Father Mason clutching his crucifix
Baptized the baby in whiskey and licorice
What a lovely way
Drowning sins in tooth decay
Looks like our hero's gonna fall
The boughs are bound to break
Cause any ol' way that I fall
I'll be in your arms as we lie awake
With our lovely new mistake
You better catch me when I fall
My sugar trampoline
Cause any ole way that I fall
I land in your arms even though it's wrong
Cause I love my new mistake
The ending turned tragic when many years later
The baby had grown up and married a pop singer
I guess it was her turn to make (her first mistake)
Any ole time at all
Any ole way that I fall
Any ole time at all
Any ole way that I fall
Any ole time at all
Any ole way that I fall
I just lie awake with my new mistake1Embed
