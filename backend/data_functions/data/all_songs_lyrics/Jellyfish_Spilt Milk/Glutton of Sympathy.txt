Glutton of Sympathy LyricsIn the breathless hush of four A.M
In the dark sits a sad clich√©
Cloaked in the navy blue
Of slowly fading stars
Tell me how this came to be
Sleeplessness talk to me
She'd say over and over again
Fumbling through a cut-glass vase
Passing lipstick, cotton spools
Burning jealous pictures of marriages
Of friends
You never asked to be
The glutton of sympathy
She says over and over
That this is the end
'Cause I see it in your eyes
What you don't know, time to let go
I see it in your eyes
There is so much more out there to be learned
Such mournful words
On this white snow vacant page
All the lessons that she learns
She packs away
Will you never cease to be
The glutton of sympathy
She writes over and over
Again
That's when I see it in your eyes
What you don't know, time to let go
I see it in your eyes
There is so much more out there to be learned
(Tossing, turning, roll away)
Indecision, won't you ever make up your mind?
(Lifetime, nighttime, wake the day)
'Cause tomorrow will see
If you've had your fill of sympathy
Will you never cease to be
The glutton of sympathy
Oh, don't you know the stars are all fading
Let the sunshine capture the sparkle of your smileEmbed
