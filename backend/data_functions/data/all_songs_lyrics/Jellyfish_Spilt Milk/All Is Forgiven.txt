All Is Forgiven LyricsHeal me darling
Pleaded the playboy bedroom eyes
Grace your sunshine
Till everything's ok, alright, fine
What's hers is his
Cause everything is forgiven
Forgiven
Though he soured the milk of human kindness
All is forgiven (all is forgiven)
Truth and avarice
Encircle his words like a barberpole
Twisted and useless
Till they disappear in her camisole
(goodnight alibi)
Throw away your daggers and pills
Cause everything's still forgiven
Forgiven
Though he bit off the nipple of human kindness
All is for
Hypocrite, four flusher, snake in the grass
Just a swindler and wolf in sheep's clothing
Liar
Yes he tries to hide the cross he bears
But splinters, like the truth have always risen
All is forgiven
Though he shelters himself in the
Shade of the wings of a stool pigeon
All is forgiven
Heal me darling
Pleaded the playboy bedroom eyes
Grace your sunshine
Till everything's ok, alright, fine
Truth and avarice
Encircle his words like a barberpole
Twisted and useless
Yeah till they disappear in her camisole
All is forgivenEmbed
