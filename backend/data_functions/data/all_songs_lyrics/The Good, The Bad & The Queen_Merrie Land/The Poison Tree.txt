The Poison Tree Lyrics
If you've got dreams you keep
And you're leaving me
I'll see you in the next life
I'll set you free
To find your promised land
If you're leaving me
It's really sad
It's really sad

Because our love is lying on a fallow field
It's the seed that you sowed
And scattered with the fallen shields

If you've got dreams you keep
Because you're leaving me
I'll see you in the next life
Don't follow me
To the poison tree
That grew up next to me
It's really sad
It's really sad

Because our love is lying on a fallow field (Fallow field)
It's the seed that you sowed
And scattered with the fallen shields (Fallen shields)
Of a last crusade to save me from myselfEmbed
