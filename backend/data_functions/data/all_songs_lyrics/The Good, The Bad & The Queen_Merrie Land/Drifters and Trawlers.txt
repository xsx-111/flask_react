Drifters and Trawlers Lyrics
I've done enough today
Sweet Lord I’ve done enough today
I've seen the jetsam rise and fall
Because they got them all
They were trawling
Down at the bottom
Where everything ends
And the lovers I have lost have gone

I've done enough today
Sweet Lord I’ve done enough today
I've seen the jetsam rise and fall
Singing back to the sands run ashore
Fixed odds and with little care
I shall go into town in the devil's name, alone

When the sea is glass
And the land is dark still
Throw away your fears
Throw away the nets
And throw away the past
When it's taken you
Half of the day to get over the waves
You carve away
An egg, fresh cream, a glass of sherry, casting sugar and some nutmeg1Embed
