The Imperial Lyrics
The Good, the Bad and the Queen, all on the pendolino
In consequence hung over, clean air and new roads
Clairvoyant Monopolies, for starlings peerless
The Last Wolf on the North Shore as the boarding city grows

A million ways back to the sea, but all been closed tonight
From sand, to slates, to skies, goodbye on shallow tide
Enjoy the Shore. White Knuckle Rides in a frack-free Lancashire
Resting hard for the Summer Season, disappearing in

They were walking on the promenade, risky to say the least
'Cause the water's running grimy here and the sparrows on day release
Drinking in The Imperial with statesmen on the floor
No sandcastles here in high tide, just hangman on the wall-

Oh, Praise the Early Ravers, up there on the moors
The acid that they gave us, we fell down on all fours
To follow the bellwether into the factories
Back to the spin. England, its blessing and it's tears
All sail!Embed
