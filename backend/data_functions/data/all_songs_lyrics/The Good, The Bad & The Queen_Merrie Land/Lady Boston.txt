Lady Boston Lyrics
Cut to the seagull
The quarryman
The castle
The barnacles
The cliff edge
The joy
Up in the tower that looks out to sea
The pink dressing room bell
Of the lady is ringing
She looks from the shadows
Out through the stained colors of old glass
The sorrows of slate and sugar cane are hers

And where does she go now?
And where does it seem to be free?
And where does she go now?
And where will she carry me?

If this is the end
The line in the sand
The blue dressing room bell
Is ringing the lord
He wishes the head of the whale
Who lived under the ice
Until shipping lanes sliced
Open the North Pole
Leaving a great hole
And where do I go now?
And where does it seem to be free?
Where do I go now?
Where will you carry me?

If I'm on the back
I'm on the back
I'm on the back of you
I'm on the back
I'm on the back
I'm on the back of you
I'm on the back
I'm on the back of you
I'm on the back
I'm on the back
I'm on the back of you
I want to be light now
I'm on the back of you
