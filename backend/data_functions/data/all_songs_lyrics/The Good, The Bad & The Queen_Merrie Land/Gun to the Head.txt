Gun to the Head Lyrics
Notice here by given
That spring guns and mantraps
To be placed on these premises
So don’t trespass over the line on the map
Commissioners for oaths
In the borough of Banbury
Require the owners of rowdy dogs
To keep them on their leads

We don’t care because we’re all animal lovers
We like to share our lives with them
Required of this song
Is a case for love
When everything else
That keeps us together conspiring to tear us apart

At the point where the sky and the earth touch
Is the head of the Unicorn
Nailed to the wheel in the middle of the town
Is the nightingale alone
Singing ‘where have you put me
I gave no signed consent
I’d rather keep my place here
And put up with your rents’
Because the sun is soft
Like the narcotics sold in Boots

We don’t care because we’re all animal lovers
We like to share our lives with them
Required of this song
Is a case for love
When everything else
That keeps us together conspiring to tear us apart


Sleeping safe in your bed
A slow motion circular film
Inward looking
The realm of moles
Pressure-cooking in the home
No approvals in the out tray
Not one today
To the city no forever1Embed
