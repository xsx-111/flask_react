Ribbons Lyrics
I am the Maypole
Dancing with the sun
I wear my ribbons white and red
I am the morning
Flowers in my hair
I am your son and heir, mother

I am the Mast horse
Riding out to war
I wear my ribbons white and blue
I am the arrow
Stinging in your side
I will never let you go

I am the last king
Standing on the hill
I wear my ribbons white, red, and green
I am the visions
The night before the fair
When you don't want me anymore
And you're not there

I am a murder
All falling out of the sky
I wear my ribbons black until I die
I am the dark wood, the river, and the blood
I am the lover lost
I am the Maypole
Dancing with the sun
I only wear my ribbons for you
I am the morning
With flowers in my hair
I am your son and heir2Embed
