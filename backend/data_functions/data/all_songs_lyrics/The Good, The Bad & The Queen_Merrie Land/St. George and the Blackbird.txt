St. George and the Blackbird Lyrics
Oh what a beautiful morning, a bright day
The blackbird is singing under your eyes, the new clay
Up with the watchman relieving the night shifts with tea and toast
The seers of the souls of us

A mother with a pram and a painted daughter
On a second marriage and hoping it will work out
She's up to the wishing well on Saturday afternoon
Passing by the Market Stall
I'll praise the family business of the day
And they're whats left of the bells on Sunday

'Cause when its out of reach you can't touch it
When you're coming down from the next day
When the broken soul that you threw away is slowly rising

And the clock has stopped and the days in limbo
Saint George is busy, he's serving up the people
Digging a hole at the end of his patio, to bury all the money in
I'll praise the family business of the day
(in limbo)
(in limbo)
And they're whats left of the bells on Sunday
(in limbo)
(in limbo)
'Cause when its out of reach you can't touch it
When you're coming down from the next day
When the broken soul that you threw away is slowly risingEmbed
