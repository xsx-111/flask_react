Walk Away Lyrics
You leave a trail of tears wherever you go
One of us will hold you, the other one won't
But I could never share your love or leave it behind
Break his heart, not mine

Can you remember tender moments we shared?
How could this true affection vanish into thin air?
He's not worth the trouble, baby, he's just a waste of your time
Oh, break his heart, not mine

But don't you walk away
You know you're going to miss me
Don't you walk away, walk away
You're going to miss me

You're going to miss my love
So don't you walk away
Don't you walk away, walk away
Don't you walk away, walk away

So I'll be waiting in the back room
Baby, when you kiss him goodbye
Oh, break his heart, not mine


Don't you walk away, walk away
Don't you walk away
You're going to miss my love
Don't you walk away, walk awayEmbed
