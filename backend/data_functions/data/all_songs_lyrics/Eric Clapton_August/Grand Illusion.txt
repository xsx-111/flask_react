Grand Illusion Lyrics
I saw you in a dream, it hit me like a bright light
Flashing on a screen, visions of my whole life
I used to chase the moment of desire
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire

It was just nothing but a grand illusion
Heart was quicker than the eye
Nothing but a grand illusion
Legend in my own mind

I held you in my arms 'til the other side of midnight
Kept you in my mind, you got me through some long nights
Standing on the threshold of desire
Caught between the madness and the fire

It was just nothing but a grand illusion
Heart was quicker than the eye
Nothing but a grand illusion
Legend in my own mind
It was all a grand illusion
Heart was quicker than the eye
Nothing but a grand illusion
Legends in our own minds
I used to chase the moment of desire
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire

It was just a, nothing but a
It was all a grand illusion
Nothing but a grand illusion
It was all a grand illusion
Legend in my own mind
It was just a grand illusion
Nothing but a grand illusion
It was just a grand illusion
Legend in our own mindsEmbed
