Miss You Lyrics
Don't change your mind
I haven't got the time to sit and wonder
I'm doing fine
If you decide to leave, I won't go under
You know I've come this far without you
It won't be too hard to be alone
I've got choices all around me
So I won't be spending too much time at home

Girl, I'm going to miss you
I'm going to miss you, baby
I can't forgive you
Still I'm going to miss you, baby

No, don't say a word
I already heard that you don't love me
In your state of mind
I don't need to hear your side of the story
Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go

I broke my back to make you happy
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care
If you think you're better off without me
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there


I'm going to miss the ground you walk on
Going to miss the air you breathe
I'm just not quite happy, baby
About your crazy plans to leaveEmbed
