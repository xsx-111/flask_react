Run Lyrics
Love on my mind, I used to be
Living it up, fancy free
Then one night it came to an end
I met that girl and the trouble began

Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
What are you going to do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
What are you going to do to me?

I was hooked with just one look
Easy prey, child's play
I knew this girl was no one night stand
Felt just like putty in her hands


Got no answers, got no cure
But one thing I know for sure
This is the girl, she's the one
She makes it so hard for me to run

People tell me
You might as well face it, she's covered all the bases
You might as well face it, she's covered all the bases
