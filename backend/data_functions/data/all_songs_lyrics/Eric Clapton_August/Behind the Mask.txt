Behind the Mask Lyrics
All along, had to talk about it
Like a two-edged sword, it cuts you and it stabs me
All along, knew you were a phony girl
Sit behind the mask where you control your world
Yesterday, he had you in his arms
When I'm holding you, I feel his bitter charms
I can't judge what you do to me
Camouflage the truth, indulge your fantasy

Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know

There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind
I'm so confused
There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind

Was I invited to your masquerade?
Well the party's over, so now take off your face
You say you love, but it's hard to see
When you're in his arms throwing rocks at me
Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know

There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind
There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind

I walk around suffering in my gloom
When I come to you sitting in your room
The truth is news I have longed to trace
So take off the mask so I can see your face

Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, baby?
Is it him? I want to know who do you love?Embed
