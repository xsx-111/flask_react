Tearing Us Apart Lyrics
You know the sun is shining, it's raining in my heart
I don't know what to do since we've been apart
Why don't you tell me, babe, what is going on?
You know I love you darling, don't want to be alone

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start
Your friends are tearing us apart

You know I can't go on, feeling this old way
You know my heart is burning, it's burning everyday
You know I love you, baby, no one else will do
Why don't you reconsider what I want you to?

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start
Your friends are tearing us apart

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start
Your friends are tearing us apart
Your friends are tearing us apart
Tearing us apartEmbed
