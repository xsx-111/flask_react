Take a Chance Lyrics
If I don't take a chance
If I don't make a move
If I don't go looking for new romance
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't play around
How am I going to have my fun?
If I tried to settle down
Would I be fooling anyone?

I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss
I don't know why I feel this way
I only know I love it

And I feel so free today
You know I feel so free today
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go
But I feel so free today
If I don't make mistakes
If I don't play the fool
If I have to worry about the heart I break
How am I ever going to learn the rules?
