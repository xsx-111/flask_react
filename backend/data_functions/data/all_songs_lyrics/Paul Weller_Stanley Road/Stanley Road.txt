Stanley Road LyricsA hazy mist hung down the street
The length of it's mile
As far as my eye could see
The sky so wide, the houses tall
Or so they seemed to be
So they seemed to me so small
And it gleamed in the distance
And it shone like the sun
Like silver and gold - it went on and on x2
The summer nights that seemed so long
Always call me back to return
As I rewrite this song
The ghosts of night, the dreams of day
Make me swirl and fall and hold me in their sway
And it's still in the distance
And it shines like the sun
Like silver and gold - it goes on and on
The rolling stock rocked me to sleep
Amber lights flashing 'cross the street
And on the corner.....a dream to meet going on and on
On & on, on & on......................Embed
