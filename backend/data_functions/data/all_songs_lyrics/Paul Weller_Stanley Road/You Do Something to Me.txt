You Do Something to Me Lyrics
You do something to me
Something deep inside
I'm hanging on the wire
For love I'll never find
You do something wonderful
Chase it all away
Mixing my emotions
Throws me back again

Hanging on the wire, yeah
I'm waiting for my change
I'm dancing through the fire
Just to catch a flame
Feel real again

Hanging on the wire, yeah
Said I'm waiting for the change
Oh I'm dancing through the fire
Just to catch a flame
Feel real again

You do something to me
Somewhere deep inside
Hoping to get close to you
A peace I cannot find
Dancing through the fire, yeah
Just to catch a flame
Just to get close to
Just close enough
To tell you thatâ€¦

You do something to me
Something deep inside1Embed
