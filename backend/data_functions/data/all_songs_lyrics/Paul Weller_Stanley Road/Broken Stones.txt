Broken Stones Lyrics
Like pebbles on a beach
Kicked around, displaced by feet
Oh, like broken stones
They're all trying to get home

Like a loser's reach
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, so lost and alone
They're all trying to get home

As another piece shatters
Another little bit gets lost
What else truly matters
Oh, at such a cost?

Like a loser's reach
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, so lost and alone
Yeah, like broken stones

And another piece shatters
Another little bit gets lost
Tell me what else really matters
Oh, at such a cost?
Like pebbles on a beach
Kicked around, displaced by feet
Oh, like broken stones
They're all trying to get home

Like a loser's reach
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, so lost and alone
They're trying to get home

Trying to get home
Trying to get home
Like broken stones
They're all trying to get homeEmbed
