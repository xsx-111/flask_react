Sexy Sadie LyricsSexy Sadie, what have you done?
Made a fool of everyone
Y'made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you done?
Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
Laid it down for all to see
Y'laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, oh, you broke the rules
One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?
Sexy Sadie, how did you know
The world was waiting just for you?
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at the table
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the greatest of them all
Made a fool of everyone
Made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, oh, you'll get yours yet
