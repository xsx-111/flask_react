Wings of Speed LyricsFly on wings of speed
That will bring you home to me
I’ll never be free - from the darkness I see
As I wait for your smile
Though my hands are tied
My feet are bound by fate
With clay at the base - as I sit and wait
What visions I see
In dreams, she floats on a stream
With Jesus at the helm, the water reeds that beg
Her boat along the way - as she comes to me
Now as the light is falling
One candle left to light the way
Sailing home to the morning
She comes to me calling
To brighten up my darkest day
& the world fades away…
With her smile
Fly on wings of speed
That will bring you home to me
I’ll never be free - from the darkness I se
As I wait for your smileEmbed
