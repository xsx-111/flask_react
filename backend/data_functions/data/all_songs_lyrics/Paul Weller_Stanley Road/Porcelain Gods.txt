Porcelain Gods LyricsBeware false prophets - take a stand!
My fortune cookie cracked up in my hand
More advice to fill up your head
More empty words from the livind dead
Who seek to explain what can't really be said
And how disappointed I was
To turn out after all
Just a porcelain God - that shatters when it falls
Too much will kill you - too little ain't enough
You shout my name but I'll call your bluff
Most who see me - see me not for real
We fake and fawn - play games 'til dawn
But I could see what you can see
And I hate too what you hate in me
And how disappointed I was
To turn out after all
Just a porcelain God - that shatters when it falls
I shake it off and start again
"Don't lose control" - I tell myself
Life can take many things away
Some people will try - and take it all
They'll pick off pieces as they watch you crawl
And how disappointed I was
To turn out after all
Just a porcelain God - that shatters when it falls
That shatters when it fallsEmbed
