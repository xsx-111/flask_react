The Changingman LyricsIs happiness
Is happiness real?
Or am I so jaded
I can't see or feel - like a man been tainted
Numbed by the effect - aware of the muse
Too in touch with myself - I light the fuse
I'm the changingman - built on shifting sands, yeah
I'm the changingman - waiting for the bang-
As I light a bitter fuse
Time is on loan - only ours to borrow
What I can't be today - I can be tomorrow, yeah
And the more I see - the more I know
The more I know - the less I understand
I'm the changingman - built on shifting sands, yeah
I'm the changingman - waiting for the bang-
To light a bitter fuse
It's a bigger part - uh
When our instincts act
A shot in the dark
A movement in black, yeah
And the more I see - the more I know
The more I know - the less I understand, yeah
I'm the changingman - built on shifting sands
(I don't have a plan)
I'm the changingman - waiting for the bang
To light a bitter fuse
I'm the changingman - built on shifting sands
I'm the changingman - waiting for the bang
To light a bitter fuseEmbed
