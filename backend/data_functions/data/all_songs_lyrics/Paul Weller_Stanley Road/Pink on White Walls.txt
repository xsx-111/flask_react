Pink on White Walls LyricsThe sun shone pink on white walls
And the trees stood so tall
Defiant, proud and loud against the sky
There’s no sign, there’s no plan
There ain’t even a helping hand
Just the bitter tang of sweet virtue
Don’t waste your time
Don’t hesitate
Life is but a moment - you can’t wait
Go and have your fun
Go and lose your mind
But can you get back to the ones you left behind?
When it comes, it comes quick!
An’ when you’re least expecting it
But the top’s the bottom, an’ the bottom is all you got
The sun shone pink on my wall
And the trees stand so tall
I’m empty now - but funny how
Defiant, proud and loud against the skyEmbed
