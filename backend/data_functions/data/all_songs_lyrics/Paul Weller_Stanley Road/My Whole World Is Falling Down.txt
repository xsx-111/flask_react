My Whole World Is Falling Down LyricsI wake up in the mornings, I think I want a drink
I can't even get water, from the kitchen sink
The dog that we both loved and raised from a pup
Tried to bite my hand lord every time I pick him up
Because I need you more
My whole world is falling down ooh yeah
Crumbled around, all around
All your tears and my hard work, we built the home we live
I turned my back on you, when you had so much love to give
Now this home is just a house, a place to rest my head
The roof must have a leak Lord, 'cause its raining in my bed
Because I need you more
My whole world is falling down ooh yeah
Crumbled around, all around
I never knew that you would need me
Even though you've been mistreated
How to know your love is needed now
My whole world is falling down
My whole world is falling down yeah
Crumbled around, all around
My whole world is falling down
My whole world is falling down
Since you been gone, I don't get no sleep
Even a part time job yeah, is very hard to keep
I miss that evening meal that you used to cook
My clothes are hanging off me girl, you should see the way I look
Because I need you more
My whole world is falling down
Because I need you more
My whole world is falling down
Crumbling down around me
My whole world is falling down
My whole world is falling down
My whole world is falling downEmbed
