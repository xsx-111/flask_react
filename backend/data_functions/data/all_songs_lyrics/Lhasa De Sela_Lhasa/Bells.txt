Bells LyricsBells are ringing
All through the drowned town
In the empty streets
And a hundred miles around
Bells are ringing
Birds are flying upside down
My heart has been lost for too long
Bells are ringing
Ships will be leaving
This was my home
Nothing's moving, nothing is breathing
Bells are ringing
Ringing me from sleep
My sleep was not restful
But my dreaming was deep
Bells are ringing
And we both know
There's nothing left to do
But walk out there and go
You could lean your head down
And rest it on my knee
You could tell me a story
That does not end this way
Bells are ringing
And we both know
There's nothing left to do
But walk out there and go
Bells are ringingEmbed
