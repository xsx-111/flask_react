Anyone And Everyone LyricsYou walk out your front door front door
Out into sound and sun
And people say hello to you
And you say hello to everyone
The leaves are falling falling down
Down into sound and sun
And no one is afraid of you
And you're not afraid of anyone
Your sisters on the open sea
Your brothers here on land
There's not enough breath in a single day
To pray everyone will be ok
The leaves are falling falling down
Down into sound and sun
And no one is afraid of you
And you're not afraid of anyoneEmbed
