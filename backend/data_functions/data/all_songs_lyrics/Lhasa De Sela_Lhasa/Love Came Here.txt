Love Came Here LyricsThere is no end to this story
No final blow or glory
Love came here and never left
Now that my heart is open
It can't be closed or broken
Love came here and never left
Now I'll have to live with loving you forever
Although our days of living life together
Of living life together are over
There's nothing here to throw away
I came to you in light of day
And love came here and never leftEmbed
