Is Anything Wrong LyricsI used to say
I'm ready show me the way
Then another year or two
Would pass me by
Is anything wrong?
Oh, love, is anything right?
And how will we know
Will time make us wise?
People outside
They know just what to do
They look at me
And they think that I know too
Is anything wrong?
Oh, love, is anything right?
And how will we know
Will time make us wise?
I've found a home
Now will life begin
I can wait another year or two
But not one moment more
Is anything wrong?
Oh, love, is anything right?
And how will we know
Will time make us wise?Embed
