A Fish On Land LyricsI had a dream last night
A fish on land
Gasping for breath
Just laughed
And sang this song
Is life like this for everyone
Is life like this for everyone
I picked him up
He had a human face
I carried him
To where the water was
A grey and still and dusty thing
A grey and still and dusty thing
I dropped him in
And he could breathe again
And then he grew
And he became a man
I knew that I would marry him
I knew that I would marry him
I had a dream last night
A fish on land
Gasping for breath
Just laughed
And sang this song
Is life like this for everyone
Is life like this for everyoneEmbed
