1001 Nights LyricsI have no way to prove it
No proof but I believe
A thousand and one nights of this
And then I will be free
My prison will be broken down
The dark will come undone
A thousand and one nights of this
And then the change will come
A garden growing underground
A treasure waiting to be found
A bird that never makes a sound
You don't have to believe it
But just you wait and see
A thousand and one nights of this
And then I will be freeEmbed
