What Kind Of Heart LyricsWhat kind of heart
Would a blind man choose
Would a blind man choose
What's better to wear
In the dark for love
In the dark for love
Than a wooden glove
Tied behind your back
Tied behind your back
Where its fingers clack
Where its fingers clack
What kind of heart
Would a blind man choose
Would a blind man choose?Embed
