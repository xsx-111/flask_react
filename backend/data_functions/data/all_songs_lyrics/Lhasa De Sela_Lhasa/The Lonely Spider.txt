The Lonely Spider LyricsLonely spider waiting in her web
Hoping she can catch some happiness
Then who should stumble into here but you
Got you where I want you
Got you where I want you
Lovely lady spider likes you best
Begs you to come live in her own nest
Feeds you clothes you gives her heart to you
Got you where I want you
Got you where I want you
Don't know why you put up such a fight
Make the lady spider cry all night
You never have to be alone again
Got you where I want you
Got you where I want you
Lonely spider waiting in her web
Hoping she can catch some happiness
Oh when will happiness come by againEmbed
