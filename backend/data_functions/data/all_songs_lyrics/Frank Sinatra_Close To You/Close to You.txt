Close to You LyricsClose to you I will always stay
Close to you, though you're far away
You'll always be near, as though you were here by my side
No matter where in my dreams, I'll find you there
Close to me, sharing your caress
Can't you see you're my happiness?
Wherever you go, my heart will go too
What can I do?
It only wants to be close to you
Wherever you go, my heart will go too
What can I do?
If you knew the joy you bring
How my hungry heart would sing
If only we could be close to youEmbed
