It Could Happen To You LyricsHide your heart from sight, lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you
Don't count stars or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble
Keep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder how your arms would be
And it happened to me
Keep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder how your arms would be
And it happened to meEmbed
