The End Of A Love Affair LyricsSo I walked a little too fast, and I drive a little too fast
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?
So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare
Do they know, do they care
That it's only that I'm lonely, and low as can be
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all
So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare
So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking her place
But what else can you do at the end of a love affair?
So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare
So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking her place
But what else can you do at the end of a love affair?Embed
