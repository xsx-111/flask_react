With Every Breath I Take LyricsI think of you with every breath I take
With every breeze that wanders by
And your name is a song
I'll remember the long years through
I breathe your name with every breath I take
And every breath becomes a sigh
Not a sigh of despair
But a sigh that I'll always care
Even now as I walk through the garden
Seems that I hear love say:
"Some day, some way."
And when I sleep you keep my heart awake
And when I wake from dreams divine
Every breath that I take
Is a breath to make you mineEmbed
