Love Locked Out LyricsLove locked out in all the cold and rain
Love locked out may never come again
Love locked out and weeping bitter tears
But no one ever hears love calling
Though we need the precious gift it brings
We don't heed the song of love it sings
On the door love beats its tiny wings
Just love locked out
A world without love is a world without life
A sad world full of gloom
So please make a place there for love in your heart
It does not need much room
Love is well worth the waiting for
When it comes knocking at your door
Fling it wide, for love locked out will come
No more, no moreEmbed
