The Truth LyricsIt’s all relative, right?
One thought, many thinkers
One flame, many cinders
One view, many windows
Love in a time without sacrifice
We want what we want
And what’s more, we deserve it
We run around panicking
Nervous, thinking
Could this be the one?
Man, they’re perfect
Couple years later
You’re chained to the circuit
Breaking them down
As if you’re determined to waste what you’ve found
But what’s true about you?
Is it the things that you claim to be true
Or is it deeper?
Lurking in places that you
Don’t dare to journey to
Faced with a new
Way of seeing it
Are you the type to accept
Or the type to clench fists and reject?
Whose truth even counts?
Is it the person who doubts
What a person proclaims they’re about?
Whose version is perfect?
Is there a truth that exists
Outside of perception?
This is the question

It’s true if you believe it
The world is the world
But it’s all how you see it
One man’s flash of lightning ripping through the air
Is another’s passing glare, its hardly there
Two people
One thinks Two’s deceitful
Two thinks One’s plain evil
One loved Two so much it was like worship
Two thought One was perfect
One said to Two
‘I’m awful, trust me
You’re so pure that you should not touch me.’
Two said
‘I don’t care, I love you
I can’t wait to know you.’
One said
‘I’m scared, I will show you
The bad side that I don’t like.’
Two said
‘Be yourself and I will be myself
We don’t need no one else
With their opinions
The past is gone, let’s move on
Make present.’
Two said
‘Ok, you’re the best.’
Well, you know the rest -
It all went sour
And now Two thinks One is mad for power
One thinks Two tried to devour
Everything that made One One
But Two thinks One got Two too wrong
So if there’s one truth that lasts forever
Can two truths ever exist together?
If One loves Two but Two don’t love
Whose truth is true and is truth enough?

In the back of the cab
The girls look at each other, like
‘What the fuck was that?’
‘I thought it was that In Da Club one.’
‘I don’t know,’ says the driver, ‘I never liked rap.’
‘Well, can’t you put it on Magic then
Or something like that?’1Embed
