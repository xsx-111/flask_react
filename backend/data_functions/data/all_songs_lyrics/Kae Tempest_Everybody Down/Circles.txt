Circles LyricsI’m in a mess, I can’t help it
I just go round and round
I’m paranoid, I’m selfish
Push me, I clam up, I’m shellfish
We had a dream, I shelved it
That eats me up, that’s Elvis
Las Vegas era
I’m half bag lady, half Bagheera
I got my hand on my heart
But my heart’s in the gutter
Talking to itself, starting to flutter
When it thinks about yours
Barking at mutts like a nutter
Trying to start wars on the bus
Dumb chunk of muscle with its claws out
Throwing its oars out the dinghy in the middle of a gale
Making whirlpools the way I chase my tail
I go round in circles
Not graceful, not like dancers
Not neatly, not like compass and pencil
More like a dog on a lead, going mental
I go round in circles
Not graceful, not like dancers
Not neatly, not like compass and pencil
More like a dog on a lead, going mental
I’m in a corner saying nothing
Sitting in a pub with my eyes closed
Swaying to a power ballad
Shredding tears at the high notes
My hands are frozen, I forgot my gloves
My heart is broken, I don’t want no love
Love just rots your guts
If you’re the type to feel what you touch
No wait, my hands are smoking on this hot tea cup
My heart is open, all I want is love
Love will prop you up
If you’re the type to feel what you touch
No wait, my hands are frozen, I ain’t got no gloves
My heart is broken, I don’t want no love
Love will rot your guts
If you’re the type to feel what you touch
No wait, my hands are smoking on this hot tea cup
My heart is open, all I want is love
Love will prop you up
If you’re the type to feel what you touch

I go round in circles
Not graceful, not like dancers
Not neatly, not like compass and pencil
More like a dog on a lead, going mental
I go round in circles
Not graceful, not like dancers
Not neatly, not like compass and pencil
More like a dog on a lead, going mental
I go round, elliptical
Watch me orbit this
I keep repeating myself
There must be more than this
I don’t know why I can’t change
There ain’t no groundhogs here
There’s just me in my garden
Howling at the moon when it’s round and clear
Kick a fag box and you might find it’s got some in it
I love that
Just when I think something’s ending
The beginning comes back
Get away with a child travelcard on the bus
I love that
Just when I think something’s ending
The beginning comes back
See something great
Happen to a mate
I love that
Just when I think something’s ending
The beginning comes back
Get a kiss when you feel like shit
That’s so good, I love that
Just when I think something’s ending
The beginning comes back
