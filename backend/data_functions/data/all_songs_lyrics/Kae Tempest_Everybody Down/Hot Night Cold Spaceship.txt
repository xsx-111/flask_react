Hot Night Cold Spaceship Lyrics
Where's love?
I stared into the depths of the woodland
Felt something shaking in my good hand
Blood in my veins, blood in your veins
Our blood wants to meet
That's why its rushing round
Pushing itself up into our cheeks

Where's God?
I feel Her, right here in the clearing
Whispering of something I'm not hearing
I'm listening as hard as I can
Guess I ain't ready yet
Too many too eager
They won't ever get deeper

Where's Faith?
Faith was in my class when I was younger
She had pretty eyes full of misery and hunger
But they kept on smiling as if they knew that the horizon
Could never burn gold without red
Now she was hiding from our teachers
Giggling, she'd stolen Monty's weakness
Made him twice the boy he was
Before he knew what sweetness really meant
He's a man now, distant and detached
Where's Faith?
Faith's rummaging around for some scraps
Her eyes roll back
She's chasing dragons in her flat
The real dragon shakes her head and stares out through the black
Into the oncoming dawn
New myths, old places
Shell toes, gold laces
Hot night, cold spaceship
Truth told, truth wasted
Too much, too basic
I don't want it, I can't break it
Everything's for sale, I can't take it
Everything is fake, I can't fake it

Where's patience?
Sitting in her basement
Waiting, we hold shells to our faces
And listen for the waves
They crash on ancient shores
They don't pause
Just keep aging
The doors of perception are swinging off their hinges
Mutated angels are banging on their symbols
Pushing out their titties
With the big based dimples
Sick taste, swallow it
Keep it simple
Follow it forever if it fills you
Find a thing to live for
And do it till it kills you
You need something to believe in
And it's a nice evening for immaculate conceiving
Keep breathing

Where's breath?
Breath packed her things and left
Too many of her good friends
Rotten in their flesh
Feasting on their kill
Now they're chopping up what's left
Divvy it up and move on
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

Make it better
It's better when we're naked and together
What's forever?
Forever's right now
Make it better, make it better
It's better when we're naked and together
Where's forever?
Forever's right hereEmbed
