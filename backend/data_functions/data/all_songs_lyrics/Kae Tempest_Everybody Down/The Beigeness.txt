The Beigeness Lyrics
Who's bad? Said the the kiddy in the Jacko hat
To the kiddy in the Rooney shirt
Dragging back
The curtains in the room in her daddy's flat
A young girl heard the truth in an alley-cat
Howling on the roof next door
Imagine that
All your idols were just like you
Nothing's beyond you
Do what you want to do if you feel that it wants you to
Look
True never meant nothing more than it means right now
When everything's fake
But you in your deepest reaches keeping secrets
Know what it takes to make a meaning means something
I’m moving through a space that some can't see
I know this space exists
So do you if your heart beats the oldest groove
Life is huge but we have shrunk it
We've made it small
We used to walk tall
But who cares, right?
We’re having a ball

Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding
Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it
All life is forwards, you will see
It needs you to need it

Go ahead, keep it in ‘til it withers you
Move fast, don’t stop, you got things to do
Tell yourself, it’s them man it isn’t you
Nod your head and believe that until it’s true
You can tell it not to show its face
When you are trying to hold your space
But it’s in you deep in your sinews
And it comes out on the coldest days
See the kid with the memory he can’t shake
See the man with the lover on his mind
See the lady with the guilt and the heartache
See the woman trying to battle with time
See the man with the blood on his hands
See the girl with her hands on her hips
Everybody say nothing. Stay bland
If you don’t show it then it don’t exist
Right?
Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding
Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it
All life is forwards, you will see
It's yours when you’re ready to receive it

You’re so focused on finding the differences
You ignore the bonds that bind us
Got my hand on my heart when the rhythm hits
It’s looking for us but can’t find us
In the valley of vanity, viciousness
Full schedules and empty containers
We’re kissing the coshes that cripple us
Enjoying the Beigeness
Do it your way and they’ll find you ridiculous
Pick apart your behavior
Their scorn ignites what inhibits us
And then we hate ourselves
And our fear pickles us
Sitting in jars ‘cause it’s safer
Some of us are happy to live with it
But some of us know it’s against our nature
Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding
Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it
All life is forwards, you will see
It's yours when you’re ready to receive it
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see
All life is forwards you will see4Embed
