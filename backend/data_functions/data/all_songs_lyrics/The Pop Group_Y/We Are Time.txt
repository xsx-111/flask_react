We Are Time LyricsNo waiting, No running
No searching behind
I will break you time
I will break your mind
Waiting
Is a crime
All will be now, dreams are too fast
You are the first, we are the last
Last, last
We are last
No sequence to follow
No fear of tomorrow
Kiss of neverness
Life of timelessness
We'll break the speed of change
We'll tame eternity
Time is within you
Shines through your eyes
We'll kill the word
Black letter lies
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Your world is built on lies
Time, time
Catch up on your bill
You got the works, so
But what to do now?
I, you, we
Are time
I, you, we are
Time
Break
Tame
Eternity
Time trinity shines through your eyes
Oh, we'll kill the word, black letter lies
Black letter lies
Black letter lies
How it's in your uncertainty
I'll break your mind
To climb
All will be now, dreams are too fast
You are the first
We are the last
Are the last
Don't let time
Catch up on your bill
You got the works, so
But what to do now?
I, you, we
Are time
I, you, we
Are time
I will break you time
It's a crime
Always we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
We are time
We are, are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
We are time
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
We are time
We are timeEmbed
