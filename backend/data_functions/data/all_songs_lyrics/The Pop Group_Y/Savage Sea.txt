Savage Sea LyricsI was waiting for a mermaid to appear
Saying come little boy drown your fear
So young we're the new explorers
With the spirit of Doctor Livingston
We'll talk to the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
We won't die together in the desert
We'll escape from the men of prey
We'll smile like the French Resistance
And laugh at the guillotine
We'll talk to the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
Disapproved of life around them
So they created a world of their own
You're my last request before the firing squad
But bullets cannot penetrate the sea
We'll hide in the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
Why should heroes always die in battle
Take the violin
We're exilesEmbed
