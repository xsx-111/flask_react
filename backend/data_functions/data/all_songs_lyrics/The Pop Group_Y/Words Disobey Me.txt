Words Disobey Me LyricsScream of my heartbeat
Those who know don't speak
Speak the unspoken
First words of a child
Words which make black white
Words which make men bite
Words which make the air bleed
Scream of my heartbeat
Truth is a feeling
But it's not a sound
Truth is a feeling
But it's not a sound
We don't need words
Throw them away
Please don't blame me
Words disobey me
Speak the first word
Speak the last word
Please don't blame me
Words disobey me1Embed
