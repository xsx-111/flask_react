Blood Money LyricsTeeth beckon you
Who says guns speak louder
Money's a weapon of terror
Spiders I can trust open my chest
An order is an order
Even when it makes no sense
An order is an order
Even when
An order is an order
Spiders I can trust open my
Teeth beckon you
Man trap
Thumb screw
Skulls teeth shine
Iron maiden
We are hungry and cold
Spiders I can trust open my chest
Boil my heart alive
Money's a weapon of terror
Who says guns speak louder who says guns speak louder
What does it feel like to kill a man
How can you wash the blood off your hands
Mercenary, missionary, mercenary, missionary
What does it feel like to kill a man?Embed
