Snowgirl Lyrics
Set fire to yourself on a train
Don't approach your life with a sword
Burning breast your heart's in flame
But your eyelids shield you from the law
I won't stamp on your coal eyes
That poison tongue tasted stone
Built out of tears so you cannot lie
The voice of the wind tells you you are not alone

Snow girl, I burn you
Snow girl, I melt you
Your hair is on fire
When I touch you you melt

Strong in the shadows
But you cannot leave your room
Knife inside you sharpens its blade
Tick tick hammer and nail
Tick tick hammer and nail
Tick tick hammer and nail
Tick tick hammer and nail

Snow girl, I burn you
Snow girl, I melt you
Your hair is on fire
When I touch you you melt
Snow girl, snow girl
I burn you, I melt youEmbed
