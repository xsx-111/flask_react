She Is Beyond Good and Evil Lyrics
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound

Sleeps on water, walks on ice (Ice!)
Sleeps on water, walks on ice
Got no father, immortal wife
I'd exchange my soul for her
There's no antidote for her
I'd exchange my life for her
There's no antidote for her

My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound

Like a dancing flame on a bed of nails
She is one thing that you cannot buy
With zero reasons for living
With zero reasons for living

My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
Our only defense is to gather as an army
I'll hold you like a gun
Our only defense is to gather as an army
I'll hold you like a gun

My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound

Western values mean nothing to her, nothing to her
Western values mean nothing to her, nothing to her
She's the girl of our dreams
She's the girl of our dreams

She is beyond good and evil
She is beyond good and evil
She is beyond good and evil
She is beyond1Embed
