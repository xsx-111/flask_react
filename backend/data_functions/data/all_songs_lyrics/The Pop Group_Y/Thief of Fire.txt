Thief of Fire Lyrics
I admit my crime
I'm a thief of fire
I admit my crime, crime, crime
I'm a thief of fire, fire, fire, fire

We do not have anything
We have not learned anything
We do not know anything
Do not understand
We do not sell anything
We do not help
But we will betray
And we will not forget

I admit my crime
I'm a thief of fire
I admit my crime, crime, crime
I'm a thief of fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire

Reject varying concepts of law and discipline
Reject varying concepts of law and discipline
Reject varying concepts of law and discipline
Reject varying concepts of law and discipline
Oh, oh, I admit my crime
I'm a thief of fire
I admit my crime, crime, crime
I'm a thief of fire, fire, fire, fire

But who to trust
When you're stealing from a nation of killers
Do I trust myself?
I'm like a tramp in its cage
Flower in Moscow
Losers take all
We are here to go
All lovers betray

I admit my crime
I'm a thief of fireEmbed
