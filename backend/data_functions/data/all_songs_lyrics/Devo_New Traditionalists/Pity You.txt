Pity You LyricsPity you
You're telling me you've got a problem
A nervous sort of contraction
A mindless kind of reaction
You never get no satisfaction
Here's to you
I know you really got a problem
A nasty kind of reflection
A dangerous sort of destruction
That makes it difficult
Makes it hard to reach
Takes it all away
From what you had in mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here's to you
I know you really got a problem (problem)
A nervous kind of distraction (distraction)
A mindless sort of reaction (reaction)
A nasty sort of contraction (contraction)
You never get no satisfaction (satisfaction)
But there's some big fat point that you
Seem to be missing and it's
Driving you
To destruction
But doesn't seem
To stop you in the least
Or halt this obsession got you
Going on back
Week after week (week after week)
Day after day (day after day)
Hour after hour (hour after hour)
From where you came
For more of the same
Yeah, yeahEmbed
