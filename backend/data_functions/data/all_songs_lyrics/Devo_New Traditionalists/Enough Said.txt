Enough Said LyricsNone of you would help me when I baked my bread
Now all of you would help me eat it
I can see that you are very well fed
This indicates that you don't need it

Stop and let me tell you what tomorrow holds for you
Stop and let me tell you 'bout a plan I have for you
Take all the leaders from around the world
Put them together in a great big ring
Televise it as the lowest show on earth
And let them fight like hell to see who's king
Enoooough saaaaaid...
Gather up the pieces when the fight is done
Then you'll find out living really can be fun
The next thing I say to you will be true
The last thing I said was false
Remember to do nothing when you don't know what to do
Enoooough saaaaaid...
You wanted a world you could figure out
But something happened while you were asleep
You wanted a good life you could brag about
Too bad they took the parts you wanted to keep
