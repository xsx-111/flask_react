The Super Thing LyricsToday
What does it take
To do the super thing (super thing)
I'll tell you
What it takes
A very simple thing (simple thing)
Iron nerves
Like the pilot of a jumbo jet (jumbo jet)
Or a girl
On the go
Who hasn't got there yet
Magnetic trumpets blowing
Synthetic saxophones
The evidence kept growing
From below
Hidden motivations
Buried in the past
Still give us strength
For the super thing
The red alarm
A rude surprise every time it rings (time it rings)
Means it's time
To go beyond
The normal thing (normal thing)
Pay attention
And be prepared
To do it right (do it right)
The super thing
The thing
That makes you bigger than life
Magnetic trumpets blowing
Synthetic saxophones
The evidence kept growing
From below
Hidden motivations
Buried in the past
Still give us strength
To do the super thing
Won't you tell me what it takes
To do the super thing
Won't you give me what it takes
To do the super thing
Signals
Start to travel
From a distant place (distant place)
Lights go out
Electro shock
Then pleasure pain (pleasure pain)
Sensations
Unfamiliar
Can make you sick (make you sick)
It's a super-
Human thing
And it does the trick
Magnetic trumpets blowing
Synthetic saxophones
The evidence kept growing
From below
Hidden motivations
Buried in the past
Still give us strengthEmbed
