Lonely Lyrics
I know sometimes, you feel alone
I know some nights, you wait by your phone
I know you wish you had somebody to hold
It don't have to be lonely being alone

Who are you when no one's watchin'?
You close the door to your apartment
Are you afraid of the silence?
Are you afraid of what you'll find in it?
Three in the morning, stayed up
Feels like the world won't wait up
All in your mind, it's made up

I know sometimes, you feel alone
I know some nights, you wait by your phone
I know you wish you had somebody to hold
It don't have to be lonely being alone

I remember, just the other day
Brought all my problems, had myself to blame
There my friends go, there my love go
I'm just sittin' here, yeah, feelin' solo (Woah)
It's not like money gonna save me (Oh-oh, oh)
Or poppin' bottles on the daily (Oh-oh, oh)
I had to learn to love me lately (Lately)
Hey
I know sometimes (Times), you feel alone (Alone)
I know some nights (Nights), you wait by your phone (Your phone)
I know you wish you had somebody to hold (Oh, oh)
It don't have to be lonely being alone

Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
It don't have to be lonely being alone

I know (I know) sometimes (Sometimes), you feel (You feel) alone
I know (I know) some nights (Some nights), you wait by your phone
I know (I know) you wish (You wish) you had somebody to hold (Somebody to hold, body to hold)
It don't have to be lonely being alone

Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
It don't have to be lonely being alone
Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
Ah, ah, ah (Oh woah)
It don't have to be lonely being alone13Embed
