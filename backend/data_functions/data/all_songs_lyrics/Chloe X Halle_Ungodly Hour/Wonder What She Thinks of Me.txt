Wonder What She Thinks of Me Lyrics
I wonder what she thinks of me
When you're coming home
I know that she smells my perfume under your cologne
I wonder what she thinks of me
When you stay awake
After you make love to her, but I'm still on your brain

I'm not the jealous type, not like the other guys
I wish you all the best, I'll help you pick her dress
And you can both go to Paris, you're livin' the lavish
I'm actually happy for you

So tell me, tell me, baby
I know this is crazy
You've done this before, so
Who are you to judge me? Me?
It's never wrong when you're in love

I wonder what she thinks of me
When she sees that mark on your neck
Oh, no, I didn't mean to go that far
I wonder what she thinks of me
When she sees my name on your phone screen
You drop everything just for me
You know behind the scenes, you tell me everything
I know you don't forget how much you needed me
And while you two enjoy Paris, your lovin' is careless
But it's not ever with me

So tell me, tell me, baby
I know this is crazy
You've done this before so
Who are you to judge me? Me?
It's never wrong when you're in love
Tell me, tell me, baby
I know this is dangerous
You've done this before so
Who are you to judge me? Me?
It's never wrong when you're in, you're in love

(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh) Love

Tell me, tell me, baby
I know this is dangerous
You've done this before so
Who are you to judge me? Me?
It's never wrong when you're in, you're in love
It's never wrong when it feels right
I'll hold you close and pretend you're mine
I'll be the sun against your skin
I'll be there when she's not listening
You can call me crazy, boy
Oh, yeah, we'll both be crazy, boy
Tell me you love me 'cause I just wanna be your baby
Well, that's the price I've gotta pay
I wonder what she thinks of me20Embed
