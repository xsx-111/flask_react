Baby Girl Lyrics
They make it look so easy
One day, I'm talking to Jesus
Then I was talking to demons, oh
All the sights I've seen
All the sights I've seen
Yeah

Then I step onto the patio
Try to listen to the radio
Try to play up on my Casio
Even try to call my Romeo, ayy
Try so hard to let it go
But today, I'm just feelin' low, oh

Baby girl
Baby girl
It's your world
Baby girl

Do it for the girls
All around the world
Do it for the girls
All around the world, yeah
Full of love, full of love
Full of love, hey, hey
Oh, oh-oh, yeah
You know my nights be teasin'
(Teasin' me, teasin' me, teasin' me)
Every day I gotta please them
(Pleasin' 'em, pleasin' 'em, pleasin' 'em)
While I'm picking up the pieces, oh
All the sights I've seen
But I'm still so clean
Yeah

Then I step onto the patio
Try to listen to the radio
Try to play up on my Casio
Even try to call my Romeo, ayy
Try so hard to let it go
I'm not there, but I'm gettin' close, oh

Baby girl
Baby girl (Oh)

Do it for the girls (Do it for the girls)
All around the world (All around the world)
Do it for the girls (Do it for the girls)
All around the world, yeah (Yeah)
Full of love, full of love
Full of love, hey, hey
Oh, oh-oh, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So don't you forget about
The little girl that you met now
The one that's in your spirit
She's still got your back, yeah
Don't you let the world take back
All the love that you gave out
This is all our world now
This is all your world now14Embed
