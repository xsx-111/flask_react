Catch Up Lyrics
Woah
Woah
Woah

I'm already— don't know (Ooh)
I said I've already talked to myself (Ooh)
Maybe it's true what they say 'bout you (Ooh)
You're in the loop if you knew what I knew

You've been used at the hotel room (Hey, ooh, yeah)
I smell the booze, not your cheap perfume (Ooh)
I'm quick to move on, don't get it confused (Ooh)
I have a future with shit to lose (Go)

Woah, you better turn up (Oh)
Oh, now you better catch up (Oh)
Front to back, girl, jigga, chimmy cha-cha, mm
Front to back, girl, lemme see you cha-cha, mm

You wanna talk 'bout me, what about you?
You like to party and hang with your groupies now
And I was up at midnight pacin' 'round the room, thinkin' 'bout you
You turn your phone off? Guess I will, too
I know you were at a hotel room (Hey, woo)
You've got her lipstick on your shirt, I'm no fool
I'm quick to move on, don't get it confused
I have a future with shit to lose
You're gonna lose me, so now I

Woah, you better turn up (Oh)
Oh, now you better catch up (Oh)
Front to back, girl, jigga, chimmy cha-cha, mm
Front to back, girl, lemme see you cha-cha, mm

Oh, you're angry, I'm just tryna party
Why you trippin' when I give you what you give to me?
You run a big game, well, baby, I can play
You don't be trippin' when I give you what you give to me, oh

Woah, you better turn up (Oh)
Oh, now you better catch up (Oh)
Front to back, girl, jigga, chimmy cha-cha, mm
Front to back, girl, lemme see you cha-cha, mm

Mm (Ooh)
