Overwhelmed Lyrics
Holdin' my breath 'til my face turns blue
Head under water
Breathe deeply, they said
I need a weekend again
Looking for bright sides
Low on the high types
Runnin' so fast, I done worn my shoes
Head on the pavement, I'm just tryin' to win
Pushed in the river, I swim
Nothing can blindside (Side, side, side, side)
Me like the high tide
I don't do well under pressure
I don't know it all
I wish I had all the answers
Fix it all myself (Oh)
I feel overwhelmed13Embed
