ROYL Lyrics
Won't you live tonight? (For the rest of your life)
Could be paradise (Never know 'til you try)
Running out of time (Baby, get up and try, baby)
Won't you live tonight? (For the rest of your life)
Could be paradise (Never know 'til you try)
Running out of time (Baby, get up and drive)
Won't you live tonight?

Hey, hey, won't you come on my way?
Hey, hey, won't you come on my way now?
Hey, hey, won't you get on my thang?
What ya doin' by the way?
Won't you get on my way now?

You wanna fly, but you don't
You holdin' on your wings
Look to the sky, why don't you?
Live for the finer things

You know, you know, you know that you fine like that
You know, you know, you know how you wine like that
I see it in your eyes, so why you hide like that?
So, come on, come on, baby, let's get down like that
Won't you live tonight? (For the rest of your life)
Could be paradise (Never know 'til you try)
Running out of time (Baby, get up and drive, baby)
Won't you live tonight?
Won't you live tonight? (For the rest of your life)
Could be paradise (Never know 'til you try)
Running out of time (Baby, get up and drive)
Won't you live tonight?

Hey, hey, won't you come on my way?
Hey, hey, won't you come on my way now?
Hey, hey, won't you get on my thang?
What ya doin' by the way?
Won't you get on my way now?
Ooh, woah (For the rest of your life)
Ooh, woah (Never know 'til you try)
Ooh, woah (Baby, get up and try)
Ooh, woah

You ain't gotta let the world get to you
Why you lookin' in the mirror like that?
Won't you turn around and shake a little somethin'
You're the best that you ever had
You know, you know, you know that you fine like that
You know, you know, you know how you wine like that
I see it in your eyes, so why you hide like that?
So, come on, come on, baby, let's get down like that

Won't you live tonight?
Could be paradise
Running out of time
Won't you live tonight?
Won't you live tonight? (For the rest of your life)
Could be paradise (Never know 'til you try)
Running out of time (Baby, get up and drive)
Won't you live tonight? (Baby)

Hey, hey, won't you (For the rest of your life)
Hey, hey, won't you (Never know 'til you try)
Hey, hey, won't you (Baby, get up and drive)
Won't you live tonight?
Hey, hey, won't you come on my way?
Hey, hey, won't you come on my way now?
Hey, hey, won't you get on my thang?
What ya doin' by the way?
Won't you get on my way now?15Embed
