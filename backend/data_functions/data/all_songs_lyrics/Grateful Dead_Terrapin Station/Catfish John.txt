Catfish John LyricsMama said, "Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John"
Come the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn
Take me back to another morning, to a time so long ago
Where the sweet magnolia blossomed, cotton fields are white as snow
Catfish John was a river hobo who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember, I was proud to be his friend
Mama said, "Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John"
Come the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg, traded for a chestnut mare
Lord, he never spoke in anger, though his load was hard to bear
Mama said, "Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John"
Come the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn
Mama said, "Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John"
Come the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn
That sounds cool1Embed
