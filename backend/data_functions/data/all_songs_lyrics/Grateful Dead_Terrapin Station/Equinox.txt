Equinox Lyrics
She reclines, closing her eyes
The sun that set is bound to rise
Night birds and fireflies settle around her
Days grow long, spring is here
Waterfalls will shine again
Our minds have gone down stream
Shooting the rapids

Oh, the arctic flame
Bright as the eye of a hurricane
We're all just the same growing children
Every moment is perfect, every sound is a jewel
Every man is a prophet at the mercy of a fool

Watch the seasons go, as sunshine turns to cold snow
Chill in the hard rain, numbers of tomorrow
The great globe spins, the music starts
Every beat knows its part
To keep it spinning in a circle
Every moment is perfect, every eye is a jewel
Every man is a prophet with the mercy of a foolEmbed
