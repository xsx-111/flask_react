Sunrise Lyrics
Gazing at the fire
Burning by the water
Before he speaks
The world around us quiets
With eyes as sharp as arrows
And turning to the fire
He clears the air and cuts it with a feather
Many in a circle
Slowly round the fire
When he is gone
I want to know him better
No one is forsaken
No one is a liar
He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water
He hums
There are drums
Four winds
Rising suns
We are singing and playing
I hear what he's saying
I remember breezes
From winds inside your body
Keep me high
Like I told you
I'll sing to them this story
And know whyEmbed
