Terrapin Station LyricsLady with a Fan
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar
Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago
Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there
Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den
"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"
The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold
Terrapin Station
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin
Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
(Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put its brakes on
And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin
At a Siding
While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again2Embed
