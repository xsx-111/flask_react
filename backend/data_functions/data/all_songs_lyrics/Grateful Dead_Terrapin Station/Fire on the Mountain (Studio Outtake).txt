Fire on the Mountain (Studio Outtake) Lyrics
Long distance runner, what you standin there for?
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
Get up, get on, get out of the door
All you got, why you wanna give more?
Dragon with matches lettin' loose on the town
A whole pail of water just to cool him down

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!


Fire on the mountain, it's turnin' around
Never gets up, and, never come down
Wrong way runner, one foot on the door
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
Maybe he's speaking for the  once more
Maybe he's loaded and dying too poor
The more that he gives, the more it would take
The thin line beyond you really can't fake
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!


...in a cowboy suit
Getting much harder to please that crowd
When the music is quiet but they're getting that loud
Put it down heavy, sip it down lean
'Bout to lay it down dirty, but play it back clean

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!Embed
