Early One Morning Lyrics
Early one morning
Just as the sun was rising
I heard a maid sing
In the valley below

O, don't deceive me
O, never leave me
How could you use
A poor maiden so?

Gay is the garland
And fresh are the roses
Ive culled from the garden
To place upon thy brow


Remember the vows
That you made to your Mary
Remember the bower
Where you vowed to be true

Thus sang the poor maiden
Her sorrows bewailling
Thus sang the poor maid
In the valley bellow
