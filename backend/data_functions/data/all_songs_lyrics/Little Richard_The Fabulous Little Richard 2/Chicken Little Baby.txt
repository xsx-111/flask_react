Chicken Little Baby Lyrics
Well, I got the blues
My baby's going to shout for joy, shout for joy
Yeah, I got the blues
My baby's going to shout for joy
Well, she says I'm her baby
She calls me her Little Richard Boy

Yes, I got a chicken little baby
I got a chicken little baby
Come on, I got a chicken little baby
Yeah, I got a chicken little baby
Uh-um, I got a chicken little baby
Everybody wants her now, well

Well, tonight I stand with my heart in my hand
If I can't be your baby, I won't be your loving man
