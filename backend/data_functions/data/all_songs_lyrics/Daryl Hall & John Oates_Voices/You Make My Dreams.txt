You Make My Dreams Lyrics
What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame
Yeah, yeah, what I've got, full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together
And a-how, I can't explain

Oh yeah, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
You make a-my dreams come true
(You) You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah, a-you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well yeah

On a night when bad
Dreams become a screamer
When they're messing with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause a-I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Oh yeah, well, 'cause you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Mmm hmm, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Whoa yeah, well, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Woo woo, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Oh yeah

Well, listen to this
Ow

I'm down on my daydream
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know

Ah you
Yeah a-yeah, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Oh yeah, I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Me, you, me, you, me
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh my, you make a-my dreams come true
(You) Oh (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Whoa ooh whoa, I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting
You make my dreams
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I've been waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
You make my dreams
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)12Embed
