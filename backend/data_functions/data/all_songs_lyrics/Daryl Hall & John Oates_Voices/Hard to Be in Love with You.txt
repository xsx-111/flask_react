Hard to Be in Love with You LyricsDon't want to face it
But I know that it's time to go home, no
I cannot say what I want to say
When we're alone
I've got to leave
But I want to stay
But where you are
Is so far from the U.S. of A
When we're more than
Half a world, half a world away
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With you
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With you
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With you
Hard to be in love with you
Operator, International 011, oh
Put your love on the line
Put your ear to the phone
Baby, it's no longer
Than a night and a day
But where you are
Is so far from the U.S. of A
And it ain't so easy
Easy on the heart
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With you
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With you
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With you
Hard to be in love with you
Ah, maybe it's no longer
Than a night and a day
But where you are
Is so far from the U.S. of A
And it ain't so easy
Easy on the heart
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With you
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With you
It's so hard (so hard to)
To be (to be in)
In love (in love with)
With youEmbed
