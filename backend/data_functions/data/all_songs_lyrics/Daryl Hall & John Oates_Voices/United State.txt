United State LyricsMake an amendment to the constitution
To preserve the state of our union
I stop believing what you say to me
There's a tragic gap in credibility
When the light is gone from your eyes
And re-entry may be denied
Do I want to expatriate
Or live in the united state
Inflationary insecurity
'Cause a love ain't worth as much as it used to be
Clean break, running away
Should I work it out some way
Watch the tress in the wind when it's starting to blow
Is the reason to leave, is it treason to go
Just appeasing you is the wrong thing, I know
Break away!
When the light is gone from your eyes
And re-entry may be denied
Do I want to expatriate
Or live in the united stateEmbed
