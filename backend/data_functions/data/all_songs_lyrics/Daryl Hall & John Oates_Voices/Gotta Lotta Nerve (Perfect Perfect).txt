Gotta Lotta Nerve (Perfect Perfect) LyricsGotta lot, nerve-a
Gotta lot, doo doo doo
You've got, you've got it
Gotta lotta nerve-a
You, you, you've gotta lotta nerve-a
Oh, no, stop bitching indiscretion
You're such an A-1 lover
Since when are you perfection?
Never true blue to me
So why you getting nasty?
Well, it's lucky for you
That I'm gonna keep dancing
Oh, I know
Everyone you know is perfect, perfect
Everything you do is perfect, perfect
Everywhere you go is perfect, perfect
So on, so on
But you've gotta lotta nerve (gotta lotta)
When you talk about love
If you've gotta lotta nerve (perfect nerve-a)
We can talk about love
Oh, you've gotta lotta nerve (gotta lotta)
To be talking about love
Yeah, you gotta lotta nerve (perfect nerve-a)
'Til we talk about love
Oh yeah, yeah
Diddy doo wop (Diddy doo wop)
Yeah, yeah
You gotta lot
I said listen to you
Oh, your roots will be showing
Better watch what you say and do
Or da cool you'll be blowing
We're talking sixteen tons of nerve-a
We're talking sixteen tons of

Everywhere you go is perfect, perfect
Everything you do is perfect, perfect
