Africa LyricsAhh Ahh Ahh Ahh
My baby went to Africa
With the dirty lens photographer
My baby land in jungle land
With a U.S. body and a real light tan
(U.S. body and a real light tan)
My baby went to Africa
My baby went to Africa
Sing it
(Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh)
Sing it
(Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh)
My baby went to Africa
With a make-up man and a love-sick lover
She get a couple o' grand and a two-piece suit
Let the folks back home see the native beauty
(Folks back home see the native beauty)
My baby went to Africa
My baby went to Africa
My baby went to Africa
I packed my bags, I gotta get to her
Before the lions and tigers try to jump on her bones
And the boys sing
(Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh)
Africa, africa
(Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh)
And the girls sing
(Ahh Ahh Ahh Ahh)
My baby went to Africa
I packed my bags, I gotta get to her
Before the lions and tigers try to jump on her bones
Sing
Baby went to Africa
(Africa, Africa)
Baby went to Africa
(Africa, Africa)
Baby went to Africa
Lions and tigers try to jump on her bones
Baby went to Africa
Baby went to Africa
Baby went to Africa
Let the folks back home see the native beauty
Baby went to Africa (repeat)Embed
