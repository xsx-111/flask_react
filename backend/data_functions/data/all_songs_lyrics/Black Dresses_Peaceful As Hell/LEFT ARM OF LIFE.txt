LEFT ARM OF LIFE Lyrics
When everything breaks down
And we're drowning in blood
Even in the depths
I treasure everything that we've become

It's like a pearl
Formed from the pressure
Of all the blood
In a world of nightmares
It's feeding on love
It's growing stronger
And coming alive
It's so scared and confused
But it still wants to survive

It dreams of a future:
Impending doom
It clings to the hope
That it might pull through
And everyone stares at it with disdain
But it's trying so hard
Every single day
All we can do is try again
All we can do is try again
All we can do is try again
All we can do is try again

All we can do is try again
All we can do is try again
All we can do is try again
All we can do is try again

Try.... again1Embed
