SHARP HALO Lyrics
I got a halo
I got a halo
I got a halo
I got a halo

I'm an angel

I'm spinning, burning, holy
Please do not say you know me
Only angels truly know me
Only angels truly slow me down
So bright
So cool
So friendly and so nice
So chill
So fun
So sharp
Blood

Games and destruction of life
What do you know about it?
What do you know about it?
What do you know...
I just wanna
HIDE WHERE GOD CAN NEVER FIND ME
All my prayers are
From the depths
From the darkness
FROM THE WOODS
CRYING PRAYING WISHING
For something better than this

I got a halo
I got a halo
I got a halo
I got a halo

I'm an-
I'm an angel

Angel
I hear you
No need to scream so loud
Reach out and touch my hand
I'm going to pull you down
Does it get any better than this?
It doesn't get any better than this
It d-
It doesn't get any better than this
Does it get any better than this?

I DONT KNOW

Spinning
Burning
Burning
Spinning
Halo
Halo
