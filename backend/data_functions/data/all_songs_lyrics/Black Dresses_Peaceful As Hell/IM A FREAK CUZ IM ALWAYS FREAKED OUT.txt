IM A FREAK CUZ IM ALWAYS FREAKED OUT Lyrics
I just wanna be nice
But everything is freaky
Everyone is walking a tightrope
So easy-peasy
I don't wanna fall
But more than that
I don't want them to see me fall
I've practiced so hard
I've tried it all believe me

I just wanna be nice
Conversations flow like murky waters through a stream
Everybody struggles, words get tangled
Twisted, sounding mean
When they don't even mean
To be fucked up
But it could still be
Really badly fucked up
But that's ok
Everyone makes mistakes
Unless it's not a mistake
Unless it's not a mistake
I just wanna be nice
I just wanna be nice
I just wanna be nice
I'm so cute and well-adjusted
I know exactly what to say
I hope no one discovers
I struggle with it every day
How the FUCK does language work
What do people like to hear??
I don't wanna be uncool but I need
TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE
I know you can see my soul
I know you can see right thru the hole
I know you can see my soul
I know you can see right thru the hole
I just wanna be nice
I just wanna be NICE
I JUST WANNA BE-

I wanna give people a chance
But they keep letting me down
I wanna be wrong again
I wanna be wrong about being wrong
This world shouldn't need to feel so lonely
Is it because I'm too angry to be around anyone again?
Ummmm... FUCK THIS SHIT!
I'm so cute and well-adjusted
I'm so cute and well-adjusted
I'm so cute and well-adjusted
I'm so cute and well-adjusted
I'm so cute and well-adjusted
I'm so cute and well-adjusted
I'm so cute and well-adjusted2Embed
