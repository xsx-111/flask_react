BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP Lyrics
I think I'm still alive
I'm still recovering but there
So deep inside
There's something slithering
Deeper, deeper, deeper in
I know, I know this feeling

So once again
Here we go again
It's all we have
Okay

Beautiful friendship
Burning up in this
Tiny little moment of time
We will always try our best to shine bright

Melt the hurt away
Beautiful decay
Transient can't take this
Sparkling rainbow
Melt the hurt away
Beautiful decay
Transient can't take this
Sparkling rainbow
Beautiful friendship
Burning up in this
Tiny little moment of time
We gotta do our best to
To try to make it last
We will always do our best to shine bright

Future burning bright
Future burning
Future burning bright
Future burning

Beautiful friendship
Burning up in this
Tiny little moment of time
We will always try our best
To shine bright
Beautiful friendship
Burning up in this
Tiny little moment of time
We will always try our best
To shine brightEmbed
