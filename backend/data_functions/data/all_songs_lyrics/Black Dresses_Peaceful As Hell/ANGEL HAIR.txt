ANGEL HAIR Lyrics
Let it go
Love me
Love me
Love me
Let it go
Love me
Love me
Go go

Sticky sticky thoughts
She thought she could be stronger
Quickly ticking heart
She's not a quick responder
Pulling crickets out of her mind
It kinda wanders
Busy busy girl, she knows
How bad you want her dead
I know but I don't care
There's feelings in the air
I breathe, I can't
Take it any longer
I just wanna have a good time

I just gotta let it go
Cover my head in sweet honey, love me
I won't fight for air, just love me
I won't fight for air
I wanna fall apart
My heart is sweet and mushy
I never wanted anything or anything
Tied up in tangled angel's hair
Itty-bitty worry, a sign
Of something larger
Tryna chill and push it aside
It's getting harder
Sky inside her head
Quickly getting darker
Itchy itchy brain
Hang on a little longer
It feels like the world has lost her
Drippy drippy dreams
It's all becoming water
Creepy creepy ship
Inside a spooky harbor
Dizzy dizzy world inside
Her dizzy heart
Her heart just falls apart

I just gotta let it go
Cover my head in sweet honey, love me
I won't fight for air, just love me
I won't fight for air
I wanna fall apart
My heart is sweet and mushy
I never wanted anything or anything
Tied up in tangled angel's hair
There's a dying world inside
There's a dying world inside my head
I can't find a way to get out
Everything is falling apart
It's alright
Alright
There's a dying world inside
There's a dying world inside my head
I can't find a way to get out
Everything is falling apart
It's alright
Alright

Alright
