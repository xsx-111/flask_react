IMPOSSIBLE DREAM Lyrics
Many bodies form a strange creature
Looks like faces blooming into nature
Everything bleeds into everything else
I just wanna live
I just wanna be whatever I am
The impossible dream of having a skin
Everything crawls on, everything soaks in
I'll be eaten by ants but I won't feel that bad
I just wanna have my body to my Self while I still Am
And I don't wanna be polluted by
All the violence that already twisted me up
The impossible dream of having a skin
Everything crawls on, everything goes inEmbed
