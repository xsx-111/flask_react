PLEASE BE NICE Lyrics
You could say anything that you want
You could say anything that you want to
You could say anything that you want
You get to choose
Choose what matters to you
You could say anything that you want
I could say anything that I want to
You could say anything that you want
It's up to you
To choose what's important to you

But don't be weird, don't be mean
You're on my computer screen
It's my world, it's my life
I'm a person
Please be nice

I thought it was easy
But everyone killed me
I'm dead in the ground

I don't even know who you are
I breathe in so deeply
The spring breeze kissing all my wounds

Please be nice it's really not that hard
The sun is rising over my grave again
I promise you'll be okay
If i'm not your friend
You can say anything you want
You can say anything you want to
It doesn't mean you're bad
But sometimes love is holding back

You can
You can say anything you want
You can
You can say anything you want to

It doesn't mean that you're bad
That you're good
But
But sometimes love is holding BACK
But don't be weird, don't be mean
You're on my computer screen
It's my world, it's my life

She's my world, she's my life

I'm a person
Please be nice

I THOUGHT IT WAS EASY
BUT EVERYONE KILLED ME
I'M DEAD IN THE GROUND

I don't even know who you are

I BREATHE IN SO DEEPLY
THE SPRING BREEZE KISSING ALL MY WOUNDS

Please be nice it's really not that hardEmbed
