DAMAGE SUPPRESSOR Lyrics
It's just rock and roll, it's not that serious

Worthless praying
Keep the music playing
Can you keep on singing with me
As the hours stretch on so evil?
Hopeless loving
Shitty beat keeps thumping
Lets get one more song in
I can't stand the endless silence dragging on

Fragile survival
Falling through the cracks of what's left

Everything ends
But I got 60% left
Battle-damage purgatory
Hell-world princess
Somehow everything's still unfolding
Somehow we're both still holding on

Die
Die for real
Burn in hell
Die right now
Kissed by fire in the night
Burn in hell
Stay alive
Hell is life
Stay...
Please...
Please, stay...

Can you be as safe as you can?
I know it's not that easy
Can you stay alive if you can?
I know it's barely up to us

There's a part of me that wants to keep destroying me
There's a part of me that wants to keep destroying me
There's a part of me that wants to keep destroying me
I'll keep coming back together again
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone

Worthless dreaming
In a dying world
That I already love so I can't give it up yet-
Aaaauggghh!
Everything ends but I got 60% left / Worthless praying
Battle-damage purgatory, hell-world princess / Keep the music playing
Somehow everything's still unfolding / Can you keep on singing with me?
Somehow we're both still holding on / As the hours stretch on so endless

Hopeless loving
Holding on
Beat keeps thumping
Just hold on
Lets get one more song in
Fuck...
I have one more song and...1Embed
