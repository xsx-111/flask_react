EXPRESS YOURSELF Lyrics
In hell where all the church bells sing
Demons take wing
Can't feel anything

How do we get
To the world inside our heads?
How do we get
To the world inside our heads?
Can we go there yet?

Come with me, haven’t you healed your wounds already?
Don't you get what you need? Why are you still weak?
Is it ok for me to be happy?
Is it really ok for me to happy?
Is it ok for me to be happy?
Turn up the radio play us a happiness song
Is it ok to be happy?
Is it really ok for me to happy?
Is it ok for me to be happy?
Hand me the aux let me play you a happiness song
Like confetti to a hurricane
Thru pain, i tried but things still stay the same
In hell where all the church bells sing
Demons take wing
How do we get
How do we get
To the world inside our head?
Come on girl, haven't you learned
How to express yourself?
Why is it so hard
To get you out of your shell?
Is it ok for me to be messy?
Is it really ok for me to be messy?
Is it ok for me to be messy?
I don’t know how to let it go
I don't know
Is it really ok to be messy?
Is it really ok to be messy?
Is it ok for me to be messy?
I don't know how to let it go
How to let itEmbed
