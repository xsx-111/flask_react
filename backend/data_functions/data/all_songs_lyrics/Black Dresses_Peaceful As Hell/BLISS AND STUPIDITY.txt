BLISS AND STUPIDITY Lyrics
It's ok to keep your soul hidden
Keep a secret to yourself
It's ok to be a bad singer
You can sing a special song all by yourself
It's ok if your soul is h...
It's ok
It's
Um
I don't wanna speak a word
Caught in a sunbeam of purity
Rewarded for my bad behavior
Burnt down bridge to recovery

I don't wanna speak
I'm caught in sunlight
Is it right to be
Burning so many bridges
What's right for me?

BLISS AND STUPIDITY
IF LIFE IS DEATH THEN I'll just live
IF IT'S REALLY GONNA BE THAT SHIT
UHUH
IF IT'S REALLY GONNA BE THAT SHIT
I'LL WRITE ANOTHER SONG
I TIED IT UP IN RIBBONS
I PUT THE SPARKLE ON
I thought it would be enough but I was wrong
I just wanna be
Liked by everyone
I just wanna see
The stars the moon and the sun
And feel at peace with the world
No enemies
But I'm still falling down
Still chasing lucidity
Still chasing bliss and stupidity

Alright um
She comes in looking kinda scary
I'm looking kinda zoned out
They say "love suffers from a guitar"
I say throw the fucking guitar out
But every day is the same
It's just more of the boring shit from before
I thought it could be something different
But no it's the same thing only much more

I keep making enemies
Out of situations
That I don't understand
I just try to keep it basic
But everything's so
Complicated
I get so frustrated
Trying to figure it out
Out
Out
Out
Out

I just wanna be liked by everyone

I just wanna be
Liked by everyone
I just wanna see
The stars the moon and the sun
And feel at peace with the world
No enemies
But I'm still falling down
Still chasing bliss and stupidity

I just wanna be
(...) by everyone
I just wanna see
The stars the moon and the sun
And feel at peace with the world
No enemies
But I'm still falling down
Still chasing bliss and stupidity
If life is death then
I'll just live
If it's really gonna be that shit
If it's really gonna be that shit
I'll write another song
Another song
I tied it up in ribbons
I put the sparkle on
Is it enough?
It's just a song

Still...
Yo
