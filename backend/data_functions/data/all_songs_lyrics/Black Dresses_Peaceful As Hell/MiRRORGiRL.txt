MiRRORGiRL Lyrics
Tell me I can be anything
Tell me I can be what you want
Tell me I just have to try hard enough
Hard enough
Tell me I can be anything
Tell me I can be what you want
Tell me I just have to try hard enough
Hard enough

A ghost-like shape
Is this everything I am?
Is this everything I am?
A paper doll
Can I be anything more than this?
A shadow-soul
Is this everything I am?
Is this everything I am?
Your mirror girl
Can I be anything else?
CAN I BE ANYTHING ELSE??

Tell me I'm just fucking confused
Show me all the things I've done
Tell me I can clearly do
Anything I want
Can't you see the look in my eyes...?
Can't you see the look in my eyes??
Can't you see THE LOOK IN MY EYES?
CANT YOU SEE THE LOOK IN MY EYES?
Just like TV
Is this everything I am?
Is this everything I am?
Not real at all
Can I be anything MORE THAN THIS??
The image blurs
Is this everything I am?
Is this everything I am?
Your mirror girl
Can I be anything else?
CAN I BE ANYTHING ELSE??
A ghostlike shape
Can I be anything else?
Can I be anything else?
A paper doll
Can I be anything else?
Can I be anything else?
A shadow-soul
Can I be anything else?
Can I be anything else?
Your mirror girl
AM I TRYING HARD ENOUGH?!??Embed
