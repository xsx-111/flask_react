MAYBE THIS WORLD IS ANOTHER PLANETS HELL? Lyrics
Can you believe that
We're still here and not in hell?
Or maybe this is
Some other world after it fell?
Somewhere far away that
Just could not be saved and
All their dreams came crashing down
Can you believe that
We still believe we can be saved?
But we just try to make the best
Of the time that's left
Try to care for the ones
Who are special to us
Drowning in blood
Drowning in love
The tiny worlds that we've become
And we just try to make the best
Of the time that's left
Try to care for the ones
Who are special to us
Drowning in blood
Drowning in love
The tiny worlds that we've become
A star...how can you be a star without an audience?
If I were a rockstar, people would listen
Oh, I'd give anything to be a rockstar!
Anything...Embed
