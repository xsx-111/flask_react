CREEP U Lyrics
What do you know about my world?
Am I just a normal girl?
Am I something to be treasured
Or destroyed
Or pushed aside?
What is the reason that you stare?
Do I make you feel scared?
I'm a building that's condemned
With only bugs living inside

Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?

Hiding in spiderwebs
Haunted dolls will turn their heads
And look at you and wonder
What it's like outside
Empty windows shine so strange
Like there's someone behind the pain
Of glass
That's my idea of a joke, did it make you laugh?
And in the wind and pouring rain
I'm so full of empty space
And the water drips and rots
My boards and shingles all away
And in the rain and howling wind
I think I feel my body sink
Into the mud and slime...
Will I ever truly feel alive?

Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Out
Do I creep you out?
Do I

Do I creep you out?
