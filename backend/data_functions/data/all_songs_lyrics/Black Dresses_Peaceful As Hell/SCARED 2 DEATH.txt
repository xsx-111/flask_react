SCARED 2 DEATH Lyrics
Scared to death, death
Scared to death, death
Bloody worm goddess
You look so pretty when you're scared to death
It'll never change
Burning bright with fear and hopelessness
Tearing through me again
Tearing through me again
Trapped in amber again

Scared to death of the hole
Scared to death of the whole world
It's all true it's all true
Scared to death of the dream
Scared to death of the seams
That you try to ignore
It's all true
It's all true

IT'S ALL TRUE!!!

Trapped inside it again
I don't sleep anymore
I don't have any dreams
I don't have a true form
Trapped inside it again
I don't sleep anymore
I don't have any dreams
I don't have a true form

We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about
We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about

We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about

We're gonna see its true form
True form true form

We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about

We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about
We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about
We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about
We're gonna see its true form
True form true form

I always hope for the best in people

Find out find out
Find out true form true form
Find out
Find out
True form true form true form

We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about
We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about
We're gonna find out
What it's gonna be about
I always hope for the best in people
