666 Lyrics
Even in hell
Sound spirals down
Alone in our torment
Our songs can reach to each other

Even in the void
Words bounce around
Echoes compound into another world
That we can escape to

That we can escape to
At least i hope there's somewhere left to go
And that we can all make it thru
My heart always ached for a thing and I never even knew what it was
My broken heart
My broken soul
My broken songs
People made fun of the songs but...

And its true we're broken
But we blend in with all of this debris
So as long as we're together
Hell's the safest place on earth for us to be
Thats all i got so far

(coughing) Sorry its pretty good... its ok

I kinda like it...

I mean
I dunno...

Hmm...

Maybe
Maybe we could fix it later

Yeah...
Sounds goodEmbed
