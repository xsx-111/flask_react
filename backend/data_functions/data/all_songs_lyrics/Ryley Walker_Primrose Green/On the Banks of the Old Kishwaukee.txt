On the Banks of the Old Kishwaukee LyricsOn the banks of the old Kishwaukee, I saw you there
Getting baptized by your daddy when all the love was there
Have you heard the way to love you?
Have you heard their song?
Have you heard the way to hold you?
When you right your wrongs
When you right your wrongs
On the banks of the old Kishwaukee, I saw you there
Getting baptized by your daddy when all the love was there
Have you heard the way to love you?
Have you heard their song?
Have you h–µard the way to hold you?
When you right your wrongs
When you right your wrongsEmbed
