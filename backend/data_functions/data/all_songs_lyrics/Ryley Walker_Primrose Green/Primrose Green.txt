Primrose Green LyricsHead for the Primrose Green
Kept me up all night
Head for the Primrose Green
Made me high
And I ran for the hill
With a head full of Primrose Green
Head for the Primrose Green
Makes my loving right
Head for the Primrose Green
Makes you mine
Lost my mind
With a head full of Primrose Green
Head for the Primrose Green
Kept me up all night
Head for the Primrose Green
Made me high
And I lost my mind
With a head full of Primrose Green
