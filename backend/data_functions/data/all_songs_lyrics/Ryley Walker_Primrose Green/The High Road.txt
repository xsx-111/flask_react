The High Road LyricsWhere can I lay my head on the high road?
Life from a dream that guides me to the high road
Paved with bricks from the man who can understand why I feel so low
Set your eyes upon me now, sweet woman
And the wild dogs run free from the high road
Going fast and going strong from the high road
Paved with bricks from the man who can understand why I feel so low
Set your eyes upon me now, sweet woman
I've got a penny to my name, can you make a friend?
That was me, the one so near
Paved with bricks from the man who can understand why I feel so low
Set your eye upon me now, sweet womanEmbed
