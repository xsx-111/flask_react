Same Minds LyricsSomebody better call me on down
Somebody better cry
'Cause we got the same heart
Yeah, we got the same little mind
Somebody better call you on down
Somebody better cry a little
'Cause we got the same heart
Yeah, we got the same little mind
Somebody 
Somebody better call me home
'Cause we got the same heart
Yeah, we got the same little mindEmbed
