All Kinds Of You LyricsI can't do another midnight alone
Never thought of you leaving, keeps me home
When you were standing by the station with your big round eyes
Yea, there's all kinds of you running through my mind
With the ???
When you were standing by the station with your big round eyes
Yea, there's all kinds of me running from your kind
With the ???
When I was standing at the station with my big brown eyes
I can't take another midnight alone
Never thought of you leaving, keeps me home
When I was standing at the station with my big brown eyes
