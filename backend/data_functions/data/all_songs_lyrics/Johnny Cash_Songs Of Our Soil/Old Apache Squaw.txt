Old Apache Squaw Lyrics
Old Apache Squaw, how many long lean years you saw?
How many bitter winter nights shivering in a cold teepee?
Shivering in a cold teepee
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
How many bloody warriors running to the sea, fleeing to the sea?
 
Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, "The next white man that sees my face
Is going to be a dead white man"
Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
Have you had misty eyes for years?
Could that mist be tears? Could that mist be tears?Embed
