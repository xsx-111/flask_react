Where Do I Hide Lyrics
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you

I still hear him screaming "Where do I hide?"
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside"

He said, she said, no she don't
Be back before morning, You know she won't
I remember that summer, like yesterday
And I remember his mother, as he was dragged away

I still hear him screaming "Where do I hide?"
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside"
A whole lot of memories, yours and not mine
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside"

Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due
Walking down the aisle, staring straight at you
I still hear him screaming "Where do I hide?"
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside"
A whole lot of memories, yours and not mine
And he asks and I say "Hurry inside"
"Where do I hide?"Embed
