Hollywood Lyrics
Please don't be too long while you're gone
There ain't enough to keep me here too long
Not like the last time I stood in line
Just enough to keep me bouncing off the walls, yeah

The new day, the new tray that comes around
Pills and all, enough to kill him while he sleeps
Is this the alley we drag him to?
Just off of Hollywood and Normandy

If it worked like she said it would
Just like living in Hollywood
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems
Just like I'm back in emergency
If it worked like she said it would
Just like living in Hollywood
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems
Just like I'm back in emergency


Please don't be too long while you're gone
There ain't enough to keep me here too long
Not like the last time I stood in line
Just enough to keep me bouncing off the walls
If it worked like she said it would
Just like living in Hollywood
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems
Just like I'm back in emergency
If it worked like she said it would
Just like living in Hollywood
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems
Just like I'm back in emergencyEmbed
