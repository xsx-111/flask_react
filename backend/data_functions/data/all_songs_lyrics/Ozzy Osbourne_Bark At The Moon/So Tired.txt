So Tired Lyrics
Time has come to say goodbye
I know it's going to make you cry
But you belong to another my love
And half a love, that just isn't enough

I am so tired (so tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired (so tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through, yeah

I've waited all this time for you
Believed your promises were true
I keep believing that you mean what you say
Be my tomorrow, now tomorrow's today

I am so tired (so tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired (so tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through, yeah

And I often sit and wonder why
You're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remaining true
While you do what you want to do, yeah

And I often sit and wonder why
You're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remaining true
While you do what you want to do

I am so tired (so tired)
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tired (so tired)
And I always thought we'd see it through, yeah

So tired, so tired
So tired, so tired
So tired, so tired, yeahEmbed
