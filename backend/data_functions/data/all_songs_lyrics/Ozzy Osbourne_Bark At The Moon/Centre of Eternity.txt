Centre of Eternity Lyrics
There's no present, there's no future
I don't even know about the past
It's all timeless and never ending
And for me to think it's all too vast

It goes forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity

The time is coming, but also going
And it's leaving never to return
It may be heaven, could be forever
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn

It goes forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
I've got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavor
Forever is a long, long time


There's no secrets and no corruption
In the center of infinity
There's no limits to non-existence
And no beginning to my destiny

It goes forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes tomorrow
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternity
Journey to the center of eternityEmbed
