Bark at the Moon Lyrics
Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light

Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Ha ha ha ha ha

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save

Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon
They cursed and buried him along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
In empty burning hell - unholy one
But he's returned to prove them wrong (so wrong)
Ooh, yeah baby


Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon
Hey yeah, bark at the moon
Oh Oh yeah, bark at the moon
