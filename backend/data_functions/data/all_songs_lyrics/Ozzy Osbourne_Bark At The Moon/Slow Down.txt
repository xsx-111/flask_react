Slow Down Lyrics
I'll never bother keeping up with you
Burning the candle at both ends, it's true
You know the writing's on the wall
Why do you ride to take a fall

Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down, and join the human race, yeah

I tried to tell you time and time again
You know you'll have to pay the consequence
Now you're obsessed with such a pace
But slow and steady wins the race

Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down, and join the human race, yeah

You seem to run around and around in vain
People are saying that you've gone insane
Tell me just what you're running from
One day you're here, the next you're gone
Slow down, you're moving way too fast
Slow down, you know you'll never last
Slow down, your haste is making waste
Slow down, and join the human raceEmbed
