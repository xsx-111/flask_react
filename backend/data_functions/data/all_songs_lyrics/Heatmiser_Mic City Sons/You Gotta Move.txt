You Gotta Move LyricsYou gotta move
You gotta move
I'll show you what you should do
You gotta move this way
And everything's gonna be okay
It's a chemical bliss or a stranger's kiss
You always lose your color and fall
And just move, that's all
Just below Dallas town
Where the sky burns bright white
I watched the sun go down
And the moon lights you up like a spotlight
So stumble and trip down the broken strip
With your planet packed in your car
And just move, don't go far
You're starting to spin in your circle again
So pull the hammer back, that's a start
And just move, pull me apartEmbed
