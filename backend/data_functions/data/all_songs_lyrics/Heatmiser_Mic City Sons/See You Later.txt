See You Later LyricsYou got a choke chain
Made out of Night Train
To keep your memory down
In quicksand from the main man
To drown everything out
Always out on a joy ride
Laid up from insides
Always at a dead stall
From sticking pins into miniature men
Who can't feel it at all
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you later
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you later
Walk through thick mud
Looking for new blood
Thinking I heard your name
Cruel imagination still giving me pain
Just to find you with your masterminder
Of one of your little affairs
Saying how he loves you now
Let me show you how much I care
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you laterEmbed
