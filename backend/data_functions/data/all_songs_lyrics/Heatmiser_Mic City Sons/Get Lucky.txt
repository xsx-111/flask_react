Get Lucky LyricsLet me put you in the play
Down all the days
Cast for your time
A sucker in the line
To be told you're so fine, you deserve the hire
Well, some folks cannot be satisfied
And they just want somebody to ride (here it comes)
And you're the one they want
To have and have (wish you could)
And never have not
(Oh!)
So take what you expect and put it in reverse
See which one of us reassembles first
They're taking you to pieces
They're taking you to pieces
They're taking you to pieces
(Get lucky!)
They're taking you to pieces
You make it really easy
You make it really easy
(Get lucky!)
(Oh!)
You're never gonna touch me with your curse
Get inside their minds before they get to yours
They're taking you to pieces
They're taking you to pieces
They're taking you to pieces
(Get lucky!)
They're taking you to pieces
They're taking you to pieces
They're taking you to pieces
(Get lucky!)
They're taking you to pieces
You make it really easy (get lucky!) (get out!)
You make it really easy (get out!)
(Get lucky!) (get out!)
They're taking you to pieces (get lucky!) (get out!)
They're taking you to pieces (get lucky!) (get out!)
They're taking you to pieces (get lucky!) (get out!)
(Get lucky!)Embed
