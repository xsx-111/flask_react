Cruel Reminder Lyrics
Dead stop on the curb
Eyes in back of my head
Curbside, inside or out parking 
I got a sore throat, I'm keeping you down
A sick desire been creeping around

Got a gallon of blood squeezing through my chest
And the closer I am to you, the thicker it gets
A knife in the back and stuck in one place
With a pat on the back and a slap on the face

Keep trying to see from a better position
It's no good
And it never really makes any difference
Never could

Sick of having to start all over again
Here comes a big insider, turn myself in
Thinking of ways to explain everything
This sick desire, don't you do a thing

Keep trying to see from a better position
It's no good
And it never really makes any difference
Never could
Sick of having my heart right all over my face
And the backseat driver's taking my place
Caught me staring at you, eyes dropped like lead
It's a cruel reminder it's all in my head

It's a cruel reminder it's all in my head
It's a cruel reminder it's all in my headEmbed
