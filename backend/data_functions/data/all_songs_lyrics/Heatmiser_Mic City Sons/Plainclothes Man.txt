Plainclothes Man LyricsYou’re everybody’s second home
Always trying to get me alone
An easy way to lose it all
Always there when all else fails
Over by the west side rails
But I don’t really need that now
I never really did anyhow
I only really needed alcohol
Something that’ll treat me okay
And wouldn’t say the things you’d say
Please turn out the light
I get a sick confusion headache trying to figure out who’s right
Dreaming on the silver strand
Waking up to Plainclothes Man
You little bastard, little boy in blue
Someone’s gonna get to you
And fuck up everything you do
Some European son
Who’s furious with everyone
And thinks he’ll win you with his angry kiss
Acting like he has no needs
Wanting you to watch him bleed
Made for each other, that you pay me any mind
Just goes to show my continual decline
They say that I’ll recover my love of her once in a while
But I don’t know
I don’t think so
There’s something that I’ll tell you now
Now that no one else is around
The sort of lesson that I learned from you
Not quite the way you planned
But I know you’ll understand
Someone takes a photograph
A picture while their sweetheart laughs
A perfect moment in a flash of light
Counting back from 3 to 1
That’s exactly what you’ve done
And I’m so unsurprised
I remember, I remember why I dream in black and white
Goes to show my continual decline
They say that I’ll recover my love of her once in a while
But I don’t know
I don’t think so
I don’t think so1Embed
