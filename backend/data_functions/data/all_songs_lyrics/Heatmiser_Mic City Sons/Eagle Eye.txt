Eagle Eye Lyrics
Back in that bar, they push the tables back
Lay you out like you walked into a speed trap
Felt my stomach drop right outta thin air
They got their hands in my pockets, even if there's nothing there
Feel like a sick mind, feel like the only one
Don't know who I'm looking for, or if it's anyone
And in the back room, they had the word spread
Come without a conscience to be leading back and into bed

What should I do?
I wouldn't know what to say
Between the door, I'd probably turn them all away
They look so bored that it doesn't matter anyway
And I don't wanna be naked
Get taken in and taken

Come in like I'm lost, just got off the bus
Don't know how to act or how to look anonymous
Feel like I'm lined up behind the cue ball
Between my pocket and the eye in the hole in the wall
What do you see when you see me?
What do you see when you see me?
What should I do?
I wouldn't know what to say
Between the door, I'd probably turn them all away
They look so bored that it doesn't matter anyway
And I don't wanna be naked
Get taken in and taken

And I don't wanna look hopeless
Look broken in and brokenEmbed
