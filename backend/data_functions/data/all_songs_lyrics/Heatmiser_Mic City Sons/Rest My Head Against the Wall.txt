Rest My Head Against the Wall Lyrics
I don't know when I lost my nerve and I started a routine
And I walked across this corner
Pinned my eyes to a shirt
'Cause I'm scared of being seen

Locked myself in a stall
Rest my head against the wall

Still drunk, I had a dream in the morning
Pin myself to the chore
Looking through the cracks, I saw his shadows on the tile
So I knocked on all the unlocked doors

Locked myself in a stall
Rest my head against the wall

And I'm not sure that I ever had the nerve
'Cause I've always felt like an easy kill
But I'm pretty sure that I'm never gonna know if I'm his kind of pill

Unlocked the stall and wandered off
Left my number on the wallEmbed
