Take the Reins LyricsI'm a man, don't you forget it, I'm not a little kid
Understand, you might regret it, treating me the way you did
Hey old man, shut your mouth and listen, this here's the new regime
I command, you could go missin', you could be off the scene
(I'm not here to pray) I'm not here to pray
(So papa don't say) so papa don't say, I'm not ready
Cos the hands feel so steady, take the reins
We got a team, we got the muscle, when things are getting tight
Will there seem, if there's a hustle, money changes every fight?
Look at me, you will discover, I'm not my father's son
You will see, when you recover, I'm mama's only one
(Look straight in my eye) look me in the eye
(Try to deny) try to deny, I'm not ready
But these hands feel so sturdy, oh, take the reins
(Take the reins)
(I'm sure in your game) I know that in your game
(You were okay) you were okay, that's behind us
Oh, Louise, is it vengeless?
Oh, take the reins
I'm a man, I'm not a little kid
Why, I understand
Shut your mouth and listen
Ah, and don't work out a new regime
Yeah, I got a team
Yeah, take the reins
I'm mama's only one
Ah, take the reinsEmbed
