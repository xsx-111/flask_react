Par Avion LyricsAnother day has passed me by
And there's an island in the sun
To see me through
Another day in paradise
But there's no reason, there's no rhyme
Without you
Here comes the night (night)
Here comes the dreaming of you
Breathing your love in me
Here comes the night (night)
Here comes the feeling I've been
Waiting here for so long
I've been waiting here for so long
There's a time and there's a place
When we can share the silver night
Silent room
In my bed an empty space
Cos there's no other in my life
Only you
Here comes the night (night)
Here comes the dreaming of you
Breathing your love in me
Here comes the night (night)
Here comes the feeling I've been
Waiting here for so long
I've been waiting here for so long
Here comes the night
Here comes the dreaming of you
Breathing your love in me
Here comes the night (night)
Here comes the feeling I've been
Waiting here for so long
I've been waiting here for so longEmbed
