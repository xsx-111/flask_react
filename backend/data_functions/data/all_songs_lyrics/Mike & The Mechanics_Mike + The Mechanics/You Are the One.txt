You Are the One LyricsTime from the man, who will live while he can, on his own
Pass by the dream, it's movie you've seen once before
Tears in the rain, as you wave at the plane
As it climbs through the clouds, to the sun
You are the one, oh, you are the one
You make it all worthwhile, you make it all worthwhile
You are the one, oh, you are the one
You make it all worthwhile, you make it all worthwhile
I see your picture smiling back at me
But I'm afraid of the future, I'm afraid you won't see
Look for the slave, is he trying to wave or to drown?
There at the start, he'll be there when your heart touches down
Drawn to the pain, like a moth to a flame
As he climbs through the clouds, to the sun
You are the one, oh, you are the one
You make it all worthwhile, you make it all worthwhile
You are the one (you are the one)
Oh, you are the one (you're the only one)
You make it all worthwhile (you make it all worthwhile)
You make it all worthwhile
I see your picture smiling back at me
But I'm afraid of the future, I'm afraid you won't seeEmbed
