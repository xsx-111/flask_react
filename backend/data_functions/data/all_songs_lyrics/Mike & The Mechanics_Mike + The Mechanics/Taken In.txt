Taken In Lyrics
Taken in, taken in again
Wrapped around the finger
Of some fair-weather friend
Caught up in the promises
Left out in the end

No pride, taken for a ride
You say I'm the only one
When I look in your eyes
I want to believe you
But you know how to lie

And if you say you understand
I don't believe it
And when you reach out for my hand
I don't believe it
And if you say you take the blame
I don't believe it
And if you say that nothing's changed
I don't believe it, don't believe it

Taken in, taken in again
Someone saw me coming
A fool without a friend
There's one born every minute
And you're looking at him

And if you say you want me near
I don't believe it
And when you're holding back the tears
I don't believe it
And when you swear that you are mine
I don't believe it
And it's your heart that's on the line
I don't believe it, don't believe it


Taken in, taken in again
Wrapped around the finger
Of some fair-weather friend
Caught up in the promises
Left out in the end
No pride, taken for a ride
You say I'm the only one
When I look in your eyes
I'd love to believe you
But you know how to lie

You say you want me near
I don't believe it
And when you're holding back the tears
I don't believe it
Oh, there's one born every minute
You're looking at him
Taken in, taken in again
Someone saw me coming
A fool without a friend
I want to believe you, oh
When you say you understand
When you reach out for my hand
Oh, I wish I could believe you
Taken in, taken in againEmbed
