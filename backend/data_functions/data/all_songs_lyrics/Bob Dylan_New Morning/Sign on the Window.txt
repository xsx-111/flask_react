Sign on the Window Lyrics
Sign on the window says “Lonely”
Sign on the door said “No company allowed”
Sign on the street says “Y’ don’t own me”
Sign on a porch says “three’s a crowd”
Sign on a porch says “three’s a crowd”

Her and her boyfriend went to California
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune
My best friend said, “Now didn't I warn you?
Brighton girls are like the moon
Brighton girls are like the moon”

Looks like a-nothing but rain
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street
Hope that it don’t sleet

Build me a cabin in Utah
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout
Have a bunch of kids who call me “Pa”
That must be what it’s all about
That must be what it’s all about1Embed
