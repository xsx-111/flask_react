Liberty Belle Lyrics
You know I love that violence
That you get around here
That kind of ready-steady violence
That violent "How do you do?"
And the lie when it's "Daddy why sleep in a phone booth?"
He's just very very tired of having
That same old boring conversation
Just like me, just like you
Man is on the nod, yeah, what you gonna do about it?

You know I love that violence
That you get around here
That kind of ready-steady violence
That violent "How do you do?"
And the lie when it's "Daddy why sleep in a phone booth?"
He's just very very tired of having
That same old boring conversation
Just like me, just like you
Man is on the nod, yeah, what you gonna do about it?

Is it easy
Just to try it?
Is it the same old line?
Well, is it liberating
Just to be so fine?
Happens all the time
You know I love that violence
That you gather when the cold wind blows down news
Of the marriage of the socialite's money to another one's land
And all but one will refuse to stand, yeah
He's just very ridiculed
And it's coming from the back row, side row, never-even-tried row
Nice man if you knew him well
I heard he owned a place called the Liberty Belle, yeah

Well, is it easy?
I think I'll try it
'Cause it's the same old line
I find it liberating
Just to be so fine
Happens all the time

Well come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Well come on, come on, come on, come on, come onEmbed
