Big Lyrics
Dublin in the rain is mine
A pregnant city with a catholic mind
Starch those sheets for the birdhouse jail
All mescalined when the past is stale, pale
Dublin in the rain is mine
A pregnant city with a catholic mind
Slick little boy with a mind of Ritz
Pulling that thread for the next big fix, this

My childhood was small
My childhood was small
But I'm gonna be big
But I'm gonna be big
My childhood was small
My childhood was small
But I'm gonna be big
But I'm gonna be big
But I'm gonna be big

Well, Dublin in the rain is mine
A pregnant city with a catholic mind
Starch those sheets for the birdhouse jail
All mescalined when the past is stale, pale
Dublin in the rain is mine
A loose ambassador for all that crime
Slick little boy with a mind of Ritz
Pulling that thread for the next big fix, this
My childhood was small
My childhood was small
But I'm gonna be big
But I'm gonna be big
My childhood was small, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
My childhood, it was small
But I'm gonna be big
But I'm gonna be big
But I'm gonna be big
I'm gonna be big1Embed
