Boys in the Better Land Lyrics

You're not alive until you start kicking
When the room is spinning and the words ain't sticking
And the radio is all about a runaway model with a face like sin and a heart like a James Joyce novel

Saying "Sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya
Let's go wrist to wrist and take the skin off of my blister"
If you're a rockstar, pornstar, superstar, doesn't matter what you are
Get yourself a good car, get outta here

Well
But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

Driver's got names to fill two double barrels
He spits out "Brits out", only smokes Carrolls
And he's refreshing the world in mind, body and spirit
Mind body and spirit
You better hear it and fear it
Oh, that's the spirit
Saying "Sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya
Let's go wrist to wrist and take the skin off of my blister"
If you're a rockstar, pornstar, superstar, doesn't matter what you are
Get yourself a good car, get outta here

Yeah
But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
But the boys in the better land
You're always talkin' about the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land

Driver's got names to fill two double barrels
He spits out "Brits out", only smokes Carrolls
And he's refreshing the world in mind, body and spirit
Mind body and spirit
You better hear it and fear it
Oh, that's the spirit

Saying "Sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya
Let's go wrist to wrist and take the skin off of my blister"
If you're a rockstar, pornstar, superstar, doesn't matter what you are
Get yourself a good car, get outta here
Yeah
But the boys in the better land
You're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
But the boys in the better land
You're always talkin' about the boys in the better land
The boys in the better land
