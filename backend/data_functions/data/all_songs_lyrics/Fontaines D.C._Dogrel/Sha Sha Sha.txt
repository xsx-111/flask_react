Sha Sha Sha Lyrics
You're so real, I'm a show reel
You work for money and the rest, you steal
I feel like an old tattoo
I feel like I'm falling for you

Sha sha sha, sha sha sha
Sha sha sha

A cabbie pisses on the wheel of his own car
Heads hit the streets, turn cheeks at stars
There's always tears
There's always gonna be tears
There's always gonna be

Sha sha sha, sha sha sha
Sha sha sha, sha sha sha

Under the lamplight's faded career
Two men at a rickshaw pumping up a tyre
Tire and tire and tire and tire
Tire and tire and tire and tire
And now the cabbie waits at invisible gates
Shoulder to the curb
Manic and wretching like a drunken perv
Now here comes the sun
That's another one done
That's another one
Sha sha sha, sha sha sha
Sha sha sha, sha sha sha1Embed
