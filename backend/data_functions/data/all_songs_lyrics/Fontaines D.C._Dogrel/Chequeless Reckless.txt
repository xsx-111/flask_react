Chequeless Reckless Lyrics
A sell-out is someone who becomes a hypocrite in the name of money
An idiot is someone who lets their education do all of their thinking
A phony is someone who demands respect for the principles they effect
A dilettante is someone who can't tell the difference between fashion and style
Charisma is exquisite manipulation
And money is a sandpit of the soul
Money is the sandpit of the soul
Money is the sandpit of the soul
Money is the sandpit of the soul

Tailored dreams of having it all
She documents an essence in a bathroom stall
An empty cheers marks an empty occasion
The empty glass is ringing, all across the nation
All across the nation
All across the nation
All across the nation


Well, the suits are runnin' and it won't be long
Until the blues cop, what's really going on?
Well, the suits are runnin' and it won't be long
Until the blues cop, what's really going on?
What's really going on?
What's really going on?
What's really going on?
What's really going
What's really going on?
What's really going on?
What's really going on?
What's really going
What's really going on?
What's really going on?
What's really going on?1Embed
