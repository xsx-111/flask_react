Dublin City Sky Lyrics
I was down the bottom half of some old bar in Chinatown
Me shoes had brought the rain and soaked the space for lookin' down
As drunk as love is lethal, I spun a lady 'round
And I kissed her 'neath the waking of a Dublin City sky

She threw her shoes into her bag and danced just like a dream
Her face was rubied up just like no sun I'd ever seen
She said I was a phony, I said I could be mean
And I treated her so badly I made my baby cry

The January markets filled the cold air with the sound
The boys all full of laughter and their pocket with the pound
And in the foggy dew, I saw you throwing shapes around
It was underneath the waking of a Dublin City sky

And it all makes sour
To watch my lover wrap her arms around the flag of power
Hurry now you will
To know you is to love you and I love you even still
But we'll never truly be
We trip along disaster in the whirlwind of the free
Altogether now
I was down the bottom half of some old bar in Chinatown
Me shoes had brought the rain and soaked the space for lookin' down
And in the foggy dew, I saw you throwing shapes around
It was underneath the waking of a Dublin City sky

And it all makes sour
To watch my lover wrap her arms around the flag of power
Hurry now you will
To know you is to love you and I love you even still
Ah, but we'll never truly be
We trip along disaster in the whirlwind of the free
Altogether now2Embed
