Diva Lady Lyrics
She's a diva lady
She's a hopeless case
She needs extra make-up
For her extra face
She's a hopeless case

She's a diva lady
She's got special needs
She wants chocolate candy
But no blue ones please
She's got special needs

She lives in a vacuum
She has no real home
Where did diva come from?
Where shall diva go?
She has no real home

She's got thirty people
In her entourage
Just in case her ego
Needs a quick massage
She's got a famous boyfriend
They go out in style
She makes him look hetero
He helps her profile
She's a diva lady
She looks down her nose
At the shoes I'm wearing
And my care-worn clothes
Such a pretty nose
Such a pretty nose, yeah

She's a diva lady
Diva ladyEmbed
