Trafalgar LyricsThrough the mist of a Celtic morning
Your battleship came into view
And though it fired on me without warning
I just can't help loving you
I'll me your marionette
I'll do whatever you like
I'm not someone you forget
I'm just like riding a bike
And I don't mind getting wet
Although I'd rather be dry
I'm getting caught in your net
This feels a little bit like
Trafalgar
I'm lookin' through the wrong eye at ya
'Cos when I do your faults don't matter
They don't matter
I'm like Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar
You've got a lot of pent up anger
But baby, just as long as you flatter to deceive me
I pray you'll never leave me, yeah
Trafalgar
I'm lookin' through the wrong eye at ya
'Cos when I do your faults don't matter
They don't matter
I'm like Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar
You've got a lot of pent up anger
But baby, just as long as you flatter to deceive me
Well, I pray that you'll never leave me, yeah
Trafalgar
Woah woah woah Trafalgar
Yeah yeah yeah Trafalgar
Ooh ooh ooh Trafalgar
La la la Trafalgar
Ding dang dong Trafalgar
Bing bang bong Trafalgar
I'm lookin' through the wrong eye at ya
It's like the battle of TrafalgarEmbed
