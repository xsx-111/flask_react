The Light of Day Lyrics
I found a photograph of you and me
Drinking sangria somewhere by the sea
There's laughter in our eyes and dreams in our hearts
Before life waded in and tore it all apart

When there's no more lies to hide behind
And no more tears to cry, I know we'll be alright
Cause even though the skies above are cold and grey
I'm sure tomorrow we will see the light of day

I found some letters from a happier time
I smelled the scented pages and re-read the lines
Why must the summer always turn into the fall?
Why must we lose love to ever know love at all?

When there's no more lies to hide behind
And no more tears to cry, I know we'll be alright
Cause even though the skies above are cold and grey
I'm sure tomorrow we will see the light of day
The light of day shining through our window pane
When there's no more lies to hide behind
And no more tears to cry, I know we'll be alright
Cause even though the skies above are cold and grey
I'm sure tomorrow we will see the light of day
When there's no more lies to hide behind
And no more tears to cry, I know we'll be alright
Cause even though the skies above are cold and grey
I'm sure tomorrow we will see the light of day
The light of day shining through our window paneEmbed
