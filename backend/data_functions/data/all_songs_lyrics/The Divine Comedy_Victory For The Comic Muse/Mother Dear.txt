Mother Dear Lyrics
It was not that long ago it first occurred to me
That my mother was a person in her own right
And now I realize how very lucky I have been
And there, but for the grace of God, go I, go I

Mother dear, she can see inside
Mother dear, and I've nowhere to hide
Mother dear, did I spoil your plans?
Mother dear, I do the best I can

When I was a teenager, I really did believe
That my parents had adopted me
And the way I carried on they must have thought
They'd brought the wrong little baby home from maternity
Well, I'd like to say I'm sorry but my

Mother dear, she already knows
Mother dear, she'll never let me go
Mother dear, kept me warm and safe
Mother dear, I'll never lose my faith in mother dear

If I ever get arrested by the C.I.A
Because they take me for a foreign spy
They won't need no lie-detector, all they'll have to do
Is make me look into my mother's eyes
And I'll tell them anything they like
Mother dear, she can see inside
Mother dear, and I've nowhere to hide
Mother dear, kept me warm and safe
Mother dear, I'll never lose my faith in mother dear
Mother dear, mother dear
My mother dear
Mother dear, did I spoil your plans?
Mother dear, I do the best I canEmbed
