Love Affair Lyrics
Here in the moment I belong
In a waking dream
The night is young, but isn't long
If you know what I mean

Oh, it's beautiful
The thought of what might be
Close your eyes so you can see

I am only here for a little while
Would you like to take me out tonight?
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby

Now we've only just begun
We're running out of time
I don't wanna think about the sun
No, not tonight

Oh, it's wonderful you being here with me
Close your eyes so you can see
I am only here for a little while
Would you like to take me out tonight?
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby
Don't hold back, it's time for a love affair
Take my hand, lead me to anywhere
Maybe there's something in the air, baby

Together here, together now
In the moment that we met
Remember here, remember now
It's too easy to forget

Oh, it's wonderful you being here with me
Close your eyes so you can see

I am only here for a little while
Would you like to take me out tonight?
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby
Don't hold back, it's time for a love affair
Take my hand, lead me to anywhere
Maybe there's something in the air, baby
I am only here for a little while
Would you like to take me out tonight?
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby
Don't hold back, it's time for a love affair
Take my hand, lead me to anywhere
Maybe there's something in the air, baby1Embed
