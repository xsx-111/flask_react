More More More Lyrics
(Give it up, give it up)
(I just can't get enough)
(More, more, more, more)
(More, more, more, more)

Here am I with my desire
Feel it burning just for you
My, oh, my, this love divine
Is taking me to somewhere new

Just slide (Just slide)
Get your body down, down, down
And glide (And glide)
I got to feel you all around

Boy, you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love, babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you more, more, more
Got to give it all up for love, babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Baby, just fill me up to the top
'Til I can't take no more, no more
Here am I and deep inside
I got a little spot for you
Ooh, make me sigh with sheer delight
As, baby, you caress and soothe

So slide (Just slide)
I wanna feel you down, down, down
And glide (And glide)
You know I need you more, oh

Oh, you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love, babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you more, more, more
Got to give it all up for love, babe
Keep me saying more, more, more
Ooh, baby, just fill me up to the top
'Til I can't take no more
'Til I can't take no more

Ooh, give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more
Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more
Just slide (Just slide)
Get your body down, down, down
And glide (And glide)
I got to feel you all around

Boy, you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love, babe
You got me saying more, more, more (Oh)
Wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you more, more, more
Got to give it all up for love, babe
Keep me saying more, more, more
Baby, just fill me up to the top
'Til I can't take no more
Saying more, more, more (More)
Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more
Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more

Ooh, hey, hey
Come and give me more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, moreEmbed
