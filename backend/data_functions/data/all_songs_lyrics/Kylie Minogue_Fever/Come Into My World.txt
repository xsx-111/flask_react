Come Into My World Lyrics
Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love?

Take these arms that were made for loving
And this heart that will beat for two
Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you
And I've been such a long time waiting
For someone I can call my own
I've been chasing the life I'm dreaming
Now I'm home (I'm home)

I need your love
Like night needs morning

So won't you come, come, come into my world?
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your, high upon your love?

Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

Take these lips that were made for kissing
And this heart that will see you through
And these hands that were made to touch and feel you
So, free your love
Hear me, I'm calling
Oh, baby

Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love?
Oh, baby, come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your, high upon your love?

Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na

I need your love
Like night needs morning

Oh, baby, come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love?
Oh, baby, come (Come), come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your, high upon your love?
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na4Embed
