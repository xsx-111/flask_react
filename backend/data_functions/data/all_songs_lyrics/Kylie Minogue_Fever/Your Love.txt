Your Love Lyrics
Open your eyes to the skies up above
Now is the time to express my love
Want you to hear my confession
You're my obsession
Do what you will do, but I can't help the way I feel for you

Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
Your love's got me tumbling upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
It's you, you, you, it's only you

Open your eyes to the skies and the sun
I wonder if this day will be the one
Want you to hear my confession
You're my obsession
Do what you will do, but I can't help the way I'm wanting you

Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
Your love's got me tumbling upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
It's you, you, you, it's only you
It's taken everything I have to get to here
You can crush my heart at any moment
But I thought it best you know that

Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
Your love's got me tumbling upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
It's you, you, you, it's only you
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over (Taking me over)
Your love's got me tumbling upside down (Tumbling upside down)
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me going around and around (It's you, you, you)
And it's taking me over (It's only you)
It's you, you, you, it's only you1Embed
