Fever Lyrics
I've been bitten by the bug
And I'm coming down with, oh
Something that can't be cured
There ain't a doctor in this town
Who is more qualified than you
Yeah, to be so adored

So, tell me, what do you prescribe for these symptoms?
A heart beating faster and work is a disaster
I'm lovesick when you're not around to check me over
When strong hands are healing, I'm dancing on the ceiling

Fever sure has got me good
What you do when fever takes hold?
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
(Feel the fever)

I am ready for the news, so tell me straight
Hey, doctor, just what do you diagnose?
There ain't a surgeon like you in any place in all the world
So now, shall I remove my clothes?
So, tell me, what do you advise for these symptoms?
A heart beating faster and work is a disaster
I'm lovesick when you're not around to check me over
When strong hands are healing, I'm dancing on the ceiling

Fever sure has got me good
What you do when fever takes hold?
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
Fever sure has got me good
What you do when fever takes hold?
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?

(Fever) Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
(Fever) Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
(Fever)

Tell me, what do you prescribe for these symptoms?
A heart beating faster and work is a disaster
I'm lovesick when you're not around to check me over
When strong hands are healing, I'm dancing on the ceiling
Fever sure has got me good
What you do when fever takes hold?
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
Fever, fever
I can't help but need this drug
Don't you feel the fever like I do?
(Feel the fever)Embed
