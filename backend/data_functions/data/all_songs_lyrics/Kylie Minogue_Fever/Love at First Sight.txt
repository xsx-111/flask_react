Love at First Sight Lyrics
Thought that I was going crazy
Just having one of those days, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

Was tired of running out of luck
Thinking 'bout giving up, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one (Meant to be as one)
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

Everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out, filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight
Love at first sight, love at first sight
Love, ooh, it was love, it was love at first sight

'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one (Meant to be as one)
'Cause, baby, when I heard you
For the first time, I knew
We were meant to be as one

It was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love7Embed
