Fragile Lyrics
(Fragile)
(Fragile)

Innocent, that's my way
Don't know where I am
Catch my breath, can't think straight
Got to make a plan

But I get butterflies
Water in my eyes

'Cause I'm fragile when I hear your name
Fragile when you call
This could be the nearest thing to love
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak
Fragile, feeling small
This could be the closest thing to love

Shake and sweat, wipe my brow
Scared of what's to come
Lie awake, toss and turn
Am I the only one?
But I get butterflies
Water in my eyes

'Cause I'm fragile when I hear your name
Fragile when you call
This could be the nearest thing to love
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak
Fragile, feeling small
This could be the closest thing to love

But I get butterflies
Water in my eyes
When I think of you
I could break in two

'Cause I'm fragile when I hear your name
Fragile when you call
This could be the nearest thing to love
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak
Fragile, feeling small
This could be the closest thing to love
'Cause I'm fragile when I hear your name
Fragile when you call
This could be the nearest thing to love1Embed
