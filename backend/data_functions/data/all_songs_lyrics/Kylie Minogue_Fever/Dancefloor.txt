Dancefloor Lyrics
On the dance floor
On the dance floor
On the dance floor
Lost me, watch me

Good times, bad times, baby, you're trouble
You stole my heart and you've given me up
And we're not even friends, so how can we be lovers?
I wanna know the truth

'Cause I've had enough
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you
Have I had your love?
Is that the best that you can do?
You can dream of changing my mind, but you're wasting your time
'Cause if you think you've got me, boy, just watch me

On the dance floor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dance floor
Got my body, gonna use it
On the dance floor
The best that you never had, but now you've lost me
So, come on, watch me getting over you
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dance floor
Gonna lose it in the music

Had your chance, but, baby, you blew it
You never loved me and, baby, you knew it
And every time that you messed with my mind
I still believed in you

'Cause I've had enough
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you
Have I had your love?
Is that the best that you can do?
You can keep on changing your mind, but you're way out of line
'Cause if you think you've got me (Think you've got me)
If you think you've got me (Think you've got me)
Boy, just watch me

On the dance floor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dance floor
Got my body, gonna use it
On the dance floor
The best that you never had, but now you've lost me
So, come on, watch me getting over you
On the dance floor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dance floor
Got my body, gonna use it
On the dance floor
The best that you never had, but now you've lost me
So, come on, watch me getting over you
(Gonna lose it in the music)
(On the dance floor)
You can dream of changing my mind, but you're wasting your time
'Cause if you think you've got me (Think you've got me)
If you think you've got me, boy, just watch me

On the dance floor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dance floor
Got my body, gonna use it
On the dance floor
The best that you never had, but now you've lost me
So, come on, watch me
On the dance floor
Gonna lose it in the music
On the dance floor
Got my body, gonna use it
On the dance floor
The best that you never had, but now you've lost me
So, come on, watch me getting over youEmbed
