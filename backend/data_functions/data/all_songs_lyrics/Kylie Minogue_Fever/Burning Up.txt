Burning Up Lyrics
Down to the disco, everything stops
Walking in solo, everyone drops
Hey, summer madness, totally cool
My heart starts racing when I see you

I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
My pulse is pumping, my heart may burst
If you drink me up, I'm gonna quench your thirst
You're not that honest, no, you're not that nice
But if I kiss you once, I'm gonna kiss you twice

I'm burning up, baby (Yeah, yeah)
I'm burning up
I'm burning up, baby (Yeah)
I'm burning up
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
Down to the disco, everything stops
Walking in solo, everyone drops
Hey, summer madness, totally cool
My heart starts racing when I see you

I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
(Can you feel it?) I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
(Can you feel it?) I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby (Yeah, yeah)
I'm burning up (Yeah)
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby
Can you feel it burning?
I'm burning up, baby1Embed
