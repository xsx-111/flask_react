Give It to Me Lyrics
(Like I want it)
(Like I want it)
(Like I want it)
(Like Iâ€”)

I never ask for much
I just want some good, good loving
More of your tender touch
I don't see the need for rushing

Take it slow, slow down
Move to the rhythm that is in my mind
Take it slow, you know now
Not too fast, make it last for the longest time

Give it, give it to
Give it to me like I want it
Give it, give it to
Give it to me like I want it

I need a shot of love
Because I got a bad, bad habit
Can't seem to get enough
Give it to me 'cause I gotta have it
Here we go (We go), let's go down (Go down)
Move to the rhythm that is in my mind
Here we go (We go), let's go now (Go now)
I'm the lead, follow me for a real good time
Give it, give it to
Give it to me like I want it
Give it, give it to
Give it to me like I want it
Give it, give it to
Give it to me like I want it (Want it)
Give it, give it to
Give it to me like I want it

Giving all your love to me
Oh, so right, so can't you see?
You're some kind of fantasy
Just like I want it
Hit by love, but don't know how
Come to me, I want you now
Feel so high, I won't come down
Just like I want it
Giving all your love to me (Give it)
Oh, so right, so can't you see? (Give it to)
You're some kind of fantasy (Give it to me)
Just like I want it
Hit by love, but don't know how (Give it)
Come to me, I want you now (Give it to)
Feel so high, I won't come down (Give it to me)
Just like I want itEmbed
