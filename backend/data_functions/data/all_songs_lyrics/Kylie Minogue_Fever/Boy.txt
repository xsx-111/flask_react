Boy Lyrics
Pretty little thing, making my heart sing
When you do what you do
I just wanna know the score, so get up on the floor
Let me see your best for me

We can make it up, don't wanna stop
You can't get enough, can you feel the love?
Feel your heartbeat and your body heat
You can't get enough, so come on get your hands up

Get up, boy
'Cause I wanna try to make you move
Get up (Get up), boy (Boy)
'Cause I wanna get to know your groove (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Wanna make you mine, you are so divine
Can't you see, you and me?
Baby, getting close to you is so easy to do
And tonight is the night we're gonna make it alright

We can make it up, don't wanna stop
You can't get enough, can you feel the love?
Feel your heartbeat and your body heat
You can't get enough, so come on get your hands up
Get up, boy
'Cause I wanna try to make you move
Get up (Get up), boy (Boy)
'Cause I wanna get to know your groove (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Pretty little thing, making my heart sing, yeah
Wanna make you mine, you are so divine, so

Get up, boy
'Cause I wanna try to make you move
Get up (Get up), boy (Boy)
'Cause I wanna get to know your groove (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get up, boy (Get up, boy)
'Cause I wanna try to make you move (Make you move)
Get up (Get up), boy (Boy)
'Cause I wanna get to know your groove (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get up, boy (Get up, boy)
'Cause I wanna try to make you move (Make you move)
Get up (Get up), boy (Boy)
'Cause I wanna get to know your groove (Yeah, yeah, yeah)Embed
