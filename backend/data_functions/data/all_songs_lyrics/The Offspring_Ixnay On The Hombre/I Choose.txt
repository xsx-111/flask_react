I Choose Lyrics
Look at me, I'm falling off of a cliff now
I can still hear my mama yelling, "No! No! No!"
But the words mean nothing, can't catch up to me now
The view is so beautiful all the way down
When I was a little boy sucking juice from a bottle
Believing my perceptions were oh so real
But I didn't know nothing, still, knowing nothing
Was just enough for me to know the way I feel

This is life
What a fucked-up thing we do
What a nightmare come true
Or a playground, if we choose
And I choose

Look at me, I'm swollen like a banana fish now
I'm never going to make it, make it out of my hole
But I keep on laughing, doesn't really matter
There's dozens of reasons for explaining my soul
When I was a teenager, sucking booze with the Vatos
Discussing who was gonna live to be twenty-one
They said they wouldn't make it; they didn't make it
We're all naked when the day is said and done
This is life
What a fucked-up thing we do
What a nightmare come true
Or a playground, if we choose
And I choose


Don't know who made this all come true
Now, while you're here, just gotta do
What you gotta do
One, two, three, four!

Ooh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh-whoa-oh

Now, if I wasn't such a weenie, do you think you'd still love me?
Pretending I'm an airplane on the living room floor
Like a lovely generator, you stand right by me
And if words were wisdom, I'd be talking even more
So I keep on falling as I'm looking back above me
Watching as my mama just becomes a little dot
Now I'm, I'm like DeNiro, I'm Amarillo
And I'll never know when I hit the ground
This is life
What a fucked-up thing we do
What a nightmare come true
Or a playground, if we choose
Said choose, said choose
And I choose1Embed
