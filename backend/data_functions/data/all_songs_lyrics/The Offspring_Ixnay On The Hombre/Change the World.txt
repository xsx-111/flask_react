Change the World Lyrics
I see the way the salesmen stare into the sun
I stood and watched them as they fell off one by one
And everyone's so blind, there not to help mankind
Reach into your bag of tricks and pull another one

Whoa-oh! You don't wanna change the world like you say
Whoa-oh! In it for yourself, no one else

(Whoa-oh!) You're ready, saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
(Whoa-oh!) You're ready, saving yourself
You're gonna change the world

Now when the day is set, they'll line up all the same
And those that need the most will never get or gain
The ones you call your friends are failing you again
Reach into your bag of tricks and make it go away

Whoa-oh! You don't wanna change the world like you say
Whoa-oh! In it for yourself, no one else
(Whoa-oh!) You're ready, saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
(Whoa-oh!) You're ready, saving yourself
You're gonna change the world

(Whoa-oh!) And since you ain't what you say
Then just go away
'Cause some don't lie
Some don't lie

Go on now, they won't tell
Go on now, save yourself
Go on now, they won't tell
Go on now, save yourself
Go on now, they won't tell
Go on now, save yourself
Go on now, they won't tell
Go on now, save yourself

I said whoa-oh! You don't wanna change the world like you say
Whoa-oh! In it for yourself, no one else
(Whoa-oh!) You're ready, saving yourself
You're gonna change the world
(Whoa-oh!) You're ready, saving yourself
You're gonna change the world

(Whoa-oh!) And since you ain't what you say
Then just go away
'Cause some don't lie
Some don't lie

I think you guys should try heavy metal
Kiss my ass! Ha, ha, ha, haEmbed
