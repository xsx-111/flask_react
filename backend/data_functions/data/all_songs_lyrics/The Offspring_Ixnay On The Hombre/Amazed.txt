Amazed Lyrics
Sometimes, I think I'm gonna drown
'Cause everyone around's so hollow
And I'm alone
Sometimes, I think I'm going down
But no one makes a sound, they follow
And I'm alone

(Oh) Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(No) Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, and if I make it, I'd be amazed
Just to find tomorrow
Yeah, one more day, and I'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting
Yeah, and if I make it, I'm still alone
No more hope for better days
If I could change
Then I'd really be amazed

And when you know you can't relate
To one more shiny face, your heart breaks
And no one cares
And when you know you can't go on
'Cause everything is wrong, your heart breaks
And no one's there
(Oh) Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(No) Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, and if I make it, I'd be amazed
Just to find tomorrow
Yeah, one more day, and I'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting
Yeah, and if I make it, I'm still alone
No more hope for better days
If I could change
Then I'd really be amazed


Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, and if I make it, I'd be amazed
Just to find tomorrow
Yeah, one more day, and I'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting
Yeah, and if I make it, I'm still alone
No more hope for better days
If I could change
Then I'd really be amazed2Embed
