Leave It Behind Lyrics
Rage that burns, can't push it aside now
Can't forgive, this grudge is alive now
All the rage eats you up inside

Can you leave it behind?
Leave it behind

What a surprise, you're fucked with again, yeah!
It's a way of life you need to get over
All the rage just eats you alive

Can you leave it behind?
Leave it behind

I don't know where it'll end
The sun has set and I can't be friends
I don't know if I can forgive
The day is long, but you were so dead wrong

What a surprise, you're fucked with again, yeah!
It's a way of life you need to get over
All the rage just eats you alive
Can you leave it behind?
Leave it behind

I don't know where it'll end
The sun has set and I can't be friends
I don't know if I can forgive
The day is long, but you were so dead wrong

I don't know where it'll end
The sun has set and I can't be friends
I don't know if I can forgive
The day is long, but you were so dead wrongEmbed
