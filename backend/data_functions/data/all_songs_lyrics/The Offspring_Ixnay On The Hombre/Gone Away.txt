Gone Away Lyrics
Maybe in another life
I could find you there
Pulled away before your time
I can't deal, it's so unfair

And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it feels, yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away

Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
Black roses and "Hail Mary's"
Can't bring back what's taken from me

I reach to the sky and call out your name
And if I could trade, I would

And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it stings, yeah, it stings, now
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away
Gone away, gone away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ooh
Yeah ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah

I'll save your soul, woah
Yeah, yeah-oh, ooh-ooh

I reach to the sky and call out your name
Oh, please let me trade, I would

And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it feels, yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away

Gone away, gone away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ooh
Yeah ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah
Yeah ooh, yeah ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah
Yeah ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah
Yeah ooh, yeah ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah8Embed
