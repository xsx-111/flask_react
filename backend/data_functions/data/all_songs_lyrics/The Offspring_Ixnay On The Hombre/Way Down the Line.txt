Way Down the Line Lyrics
Nothing changes, 'cause it's all the same
The world you get's the one you give away
It all just happens again, way down the line

There is a chain that's never broken
You know the story, it's sad, but true
An angry man gets drunk and beats his kids
The same old way his drunken father did
What comes around, well, it goes around

Nothing changes, 'cause it's all the same
The world you get's the one you give away
It all just happens again, way down the line

At seventeen, Shannon is pregnant
Young as her mom when she had her
Her kid is never gonna have a dad
The same old way that Shannon never had
What comes around, well, it goes around

Nothing changes, 'cause it's all the same
The world you get's the one you give away
It all just happens again, way down the line
And all the things you learn when you're a kid
You'll fuck up just like your parents did
It all just happens again, way down the line
And welfare moms have kids on welfare
And fat parents, they have fat kids too
You know it's never gonna end
The same old cycle's gonna start again
What comes around, well, it goes around

Nothing changes, 'cause it's all the same
The world you get's the one you give away
It all just happens again, way down the line
And all the things you learn when you're a kid
You'll fuck up just like your parents did
It all just happens again, way down the line2Embed
