Cool to Hate Lyrics
I hate a lot of things, I hate a lot of people that are lame
I like to hate stuff, 'cause then I don't have to try to make a change

I hate teachers, I hate school
I hate the cheerleaders and anyone who's cool, yeah
I hate the office, I hate the Quad
Don't wanna learn nothing, I want to be a slob

It's cool to hate (Hey) It's cool to hate (Ho-oh)
Don't like nothing, and I like that fine
It's cool to hate (Hey) It's cool to hate (Ho-oh)
Don't like nothing, and I like that fine
Don't like nothing, and I like that fine
Yeah I hate everything, I even hate you too, so fuck you

I'm always thinking that I never have nothing good to say
I'd rather tear things down than build them up, it's easier that way

I hate the jocks and I hate the geeks
I hate the trendies, but I also hate the freaks, yeah
I hate Dr. Martens and Muscle T's
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery
It's cool to hate (Hey) It's cool to hate (Ho-oh)
Liking something's just a waste of time
It's cool to hate (Hey) It's cool to hate (Ho-oh)
Liking something's just a waste of time
Liking something's just a waste of time
Yeah I hate everything, I even hate me too, so fuck you

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate
It's cool to hate

I'll cut you down and give you lip
Being positive's so unhip
I'll cut you down, 'cause I'm a fool
Being positive's so uncool
Being positive's so uncool
Being positive's so uncool
So, I hate the jocks and I hate the geeks
I hate the trendies, but I also hate the freaks, yeah
I hate your band and I hate TV
I'm only happy when I'm in my misery

It's cool to hate (Hey) It's cool to hate (Ho-oh)
Don't like nothing, and I like that fine
It's cool to hate (Hey) It's cool to hate (Ho-oh)
Don't like nothing, and I like that fine
Don't like nothing, and I like that fine
Yeah I hate everything, I even hate you too, so fuck youEmbed
