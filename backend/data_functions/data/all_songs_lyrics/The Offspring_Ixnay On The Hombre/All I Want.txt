All I Want Lyrics
Okay! Ya ya ya ya ya!

Day after day (Your home life's a wreck)
The powers that be just breathe down your neck
You get no respect (You get no relief)
You gotta speak up and yell out your piece

So back off your rules, back off the jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, asking a lot
I don't wanna be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

How many times (Is it gonna take)
'Til someone around you hears what you say?
You've tried being cool (You feel like a lie)
You've played by their rules, now it's their turn to try
So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, not asking a lot
Just don't want to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want

I said it before, I'll say it again
If you could just listen, then it might make sense

So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, not asking a lot
Just don't want to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!3Embed
