Me & My Old Lady Lyrics
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain

Me and my old lady
Lay in bed all day
And when I say I love her, well
She rolls the other way
But really she don't mean it
Everything she says
Still, if I believe in love
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong with my head

Me and my old lady
Sit and sip on wine
And when she says she loves me, well
I say that love is blind
But really I don't mean it
Everything I say
Still, if she believes in love
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong with her head
So what if we're making a scene now?
You know she don't give a shit (Oh)
When she's pawin' and grabbin' on me now
You know I don't mind a bit
It's all good and we ain't gonna change now
The world is unaware (Oh)
So if you want, go on and stare
'Cause we don't care
We don't care (Shout!)

She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and!
She ain't no ball and!

Me and my old lady
Suck each other dry
And when in that position, I'm
The luckiest man alive
Quenching our libidos
Passing time away
Now that we believe in love
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong with our heads
So what if we're making a scene now?
You know she don't give a shit
When she's pawin' and grabbin' on me now
You know I don't mind a bit
It's all good and we ain't gonna change now
The world is unaware (Oh)
So if you want, go on and stare
'Cause we don't care
We don't care (Shout!)

She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and chain
She ain't no ball and!
She ain't no ball and!
