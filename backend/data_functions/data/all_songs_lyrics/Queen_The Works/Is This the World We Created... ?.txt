Is This the World We Created... ? Lyrics
Just look at all those hungry
Mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

You know that everyday
A helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care
Inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man
Is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God in the sky, looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that he created?7Embed
