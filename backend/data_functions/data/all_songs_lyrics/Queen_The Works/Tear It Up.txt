Tear It Up Lyrics
Are you ready?
Hey, are you ready?
We're gonna turn it up!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn me loose, baby

Hey, give me your mind, baby
Give me your body
Give me some time, baby
Let's have a party
It ain't no time for sleepin', baby
Soon it's round your street I'm creeping
You better be ready

We're gonna tear it up, stir it up
Break it up, baby
You gotta tear it up, shake it up
Make it up as you go along
Tear it up, square it up
Wake it up, baby
Tear it up, stir it up
Stake it out, and you can't go wrong
Hey! Listen
I love you 'cause you're sweet
I love you 'cause you're naughty
Yeah, I love you for your mind
Baby, give me your body
Oh, I wanna be a toy
At your birthday party
Wind me up, wind me up
Wind me up, let me go
Yeah

Tear it up, stir it up
Break it up, let me go
Tear it up, shake it up
Make it up as you go along
Tear it up, turn it up
Burn it up

Are you ready? (Oh yeah!)
Baby, baby, baby
Are you ready for me? (Oh yeah!)
Baby, baby, baby
Are you ready for love? (Oh yeah!)
Are you ready, are you ready
Are you ready for me? (Oh yeah!)
I love you so near, I love you so far
I gotta tell you, baby
You're driving me ga ga5Embed
