Machines (Or Back to Humans) Lyrics
Machines, machines
Machines, machines
Machines machines
Machines, machines

It's a machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for rock 'n' roll
They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man

They freeze me, they burn me
They squeeze me, they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons
Of steel they compress me
But no one, but no one
But no one can wrest me away
Back to Humans

We have no disease
No troubles of mind
We are fighting for peace
No regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception
Of love or defeat
What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and mega chips for tea
It's that Machine, boys
With random access memory
Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold, yeah

It's software, its hardware
Its heartbeat, is time-share
It's midwife's, a disk drive
It's sex-life is quantized
It's self-perpetuating
A parahumanoidarianised
Back to Humans
Back to Humans

Back to Machines
Machines, machines
Machines, machines

Living in a new world
Thinking in the past (humans)
Living in a new world
How you gonna last? (humans)
Machine world
It's a Machine's world
Back to Humans
Back to HumansEmbed
