Man on the Prowl Lyrics
Hey, I'm gonna take a little
Walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely

So come home, come home
If you don't you're gonna
Break my heart

Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I am on the loose and I am
Looking for trouble
So look out, look out
I'm a man on the prowl

I don't want to be a rock and roll steady
I just want to be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass
So honey, come home
Don't leave me when I am
Feeling so lonely
Come home, come home
If you don't you are going
To break my heart

Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm
Looking for trouble
So look out, look out
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl

Well, I keep dreaming about my baby
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere
I gotta teach my baby dancing
But I am not Fred Astaire

So baby look out
I am a man on the prowl
Look out
Man on the prowl, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby, baby look out
Man on the prowl
Baby come home
I am on the loose and I'm
Looking for trouble
Baby come home, oh yeah
'Cause I am a man on the prowl
So honey come home, come home
'Cause I am a man on the prowl, yeah
Man on the prowl, yeah, hey
Steady there
Loosen up, whoo!4Embed
