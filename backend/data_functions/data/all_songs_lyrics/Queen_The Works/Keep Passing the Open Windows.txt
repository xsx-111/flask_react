Keep Passing the Open Windows Lyrics
This is the only life for me (yeah)
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need
Love is all you need

Do you know what it is like
To be alone in this world
When you're down and out
On your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming
In the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing
Everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down
And you're flat on your back
A brand new day's beginning
Get that sunny feeling
And you're on your way
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

Do you know how it feels
When you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money
To spend, you're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days
You're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger, yeah
That same old feeling
Just keeps burning deep inside
You keep telling yourself
It's gonna be the end
Oh, get yourself together
Things are looking better every day

Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
This is the only life for me (yeah)
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just got to be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need

Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need
Love is all you need
Baby, love is all you need

Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows2Embed
