Racks Lyrics
Ah, ah

Money, help me get by, it don't matter if I-
Caught myself expensive things, buy myself a diamond ring
Married to the mula, still ain’t got no lover
Lookin' all I see is green, wonder can you buy me these?

It's hard to trust the things that we lust
No fallin’ in love, we so out of touch
When no one's around, who's holdin' you down?
It seems like the only thing you know is

All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They don’t understand, they don’t know how to get the stacks up
If I drop a hundred bands, I'ma get it right back up
And if I fall it don’t matter, I'ma ball get the bag, yeah
Spend it all when I'm sad, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's hard to trust the things that we lust
No fallin’ in love, we so out of touch (Touch)
When no one's around, who's holdin' you down?
It seems like the only thing you know is

All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh
Now you know a young nigga got them racks up on me
I can introduce you to my rapper homies
But I ain't gon' take you to the matrimony
Probably gon' leave you down, sad and lonely
My infatuation with these bags I'm facin'
Got a couple dollars so congratulations
Tryna find love, so I'm navigatin'
Shower you with gifts, oversaturation
But I can't seem to find love without the ratchet shit
This gold dream of mine, why am I attached to this?
But happiness is when you glad in bliss
And the cash and shit is a catalyst
To cover up the pain, that's hazardous
The trouble, lust, and fame is attackin' quick
Oh my God

All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of your racks and things (Racks)
All of your racks and things (All of your racks)
They don't relax your pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)17Embed
