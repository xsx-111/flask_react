Be on My Way (Full) Lyrics
If I'm giving you the cold shoulder
That's closure, needed someone to hold
But we both had our own motives
Never told him that mine was to stay alone

And you don't belong to me
So you don't have to let me go
Doesn't always have to be something more

I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way
I'm no good if I stay
So I'll be on my way, my way

I feel it for a moment
In the moment, I feel it 'til it's gone
I don't care if you want this
Being honest, I don't know what I want

And you don't belong to me
You were never mine before
So it doesn't need to be something more
I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way
I'm no good if I stay
So I'll be on my way, my way

I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way
I'm no good if I stay
So I'll be on my way, my way1Embed
