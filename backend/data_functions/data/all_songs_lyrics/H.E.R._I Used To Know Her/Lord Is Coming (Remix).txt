Lord Is Coming (Remix) Lyrics
One, two, one

Everyday I pray for mankind
We're all slaves to a generation socialized and sickness is in the mind
We are habitual thinkers, substance abusers and habitual drinkers
But free your mind because the plug is watching from the top floor
Hoping you too will fall for the illusions of a temporary high
What we think we need to get by
But are we really trying when kids are dying and depression is trending?
Are these the signs of an Armageddon?
We're all in denial and it's all cool until you're suicidal
We never learn from our so called idols
We're just repeating the cycle so-
I never read the news anymore, it's hard not to feel hopeless
When no one noticed the explosion came from a man who's legal gun was loaded
It's all watered down and sugarcoated
We voted, but did we really get to chose?
We don't need proof that they separate us from the truth
Mothers and fathers are being separated from their youth
And they're selling the American Dream and what it appears to be
But they don't teach us that wealth is unattainable with their currency
History is not my brother's story
The original founders were buried in the ground where men have planted seeds of disease
And they've justified being thieves
Feeding their inner demons and blaming the minorities
It's a World War III, corruption versus greed
Not you versus me
But do we ever think of the need for inner peace?
They can't put a price on your soul
Don't matter your religion, right and wrong is something everybody knows
They pick and choose what's equal
Who's good and who's evil
And this is the devil's world, but the Lord is coming for his people

We're like Daniel in the den
Surrounded by these hungry lions
Looking in the jaws of death
We reach for saving hands
No help will come from men
The Lord is coming

Well the Red Sea's closing in
There's no safety in almighty horses
Can you feel the drivin' wind?
Behold the crashing waves
The Savior's on his way
The Lord is coming

Coming, coming
Hurry, hurry
Bring us to the promise land
Glory, glory
We reach for saving hands
No help will come from men
The Lord is coming
Yeah, uh
See, I know how it feels in a late night
Swimming with the great whites
Drowning in the deep waters
You got three daughters
Could use some resources, nah
We just need order
I got my own bad news, forget a reporter
Man, we ain't even safe, they wanna deport us
Or rather keep us boxed in on the street corners
If you gon' stop and frisk a nigga, shit, at least warn us
My dawg still on probation, they got a leash on us
Far from stupid, in fact, I'm smarter than Harvard students
Sparked a movement and put an end to this garbage music
Got me thinking like this can't be life
Man, y'all idiots, y'all voted for the Antichrist
Living in this false reality
It's in this picture gallery
Based on a nigga's profile
We guess their salary
The lifestyle you advertise, quite strategized
Make a minimal amount and then we maximize
Y'all niggas capping with lies, how they capitalize
Creating their own perception, what a massive facade
Digital marketing schemes, even broader regime
Live how you want on the internet, who thought of this thing?
Now I'm a new man, need to find a new plan
God bless America, God bless Sudan
Now I'm a new man, need to find a new plan
God bless America, and God bless Sudan
Oh, glory, glory, we reach for saving hands
No help will come from men
The Lord is coming (The Lord is coming)

The Lord is coming (The Lord is coming)
The Lord is coming (The Lord is coming)
The Lord is coming
