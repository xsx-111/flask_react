Going (Full) Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

Wish I could be where you are
I know the distance is far
I've been running, running through your mind
Promise that I'm on a flight, going to you right now
I don't have much time with you tonight

I've been going
I've been going, I've been focused
Just be with me in the moment
Trust me, I know how you feel right now
Baby that's just what it is right now
Just stay with me, right behind you
And I'm trying to make the time to
Baby, that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now
Yeah, yeah
Baby, that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now
Baby, that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now
I'm on the road
I've been in and out of timezones, I
Keep missing your calls
You were sleeping by the time I got home
I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to hear me

I've been going
I've been going, I've been focused
Just be with me in the moment
Trust me, I know how you feel right now
Baby that's just what it is right now
Just stay with me, right behind you
And I'm trying to make the time to
Baby, that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now
Yeah, yeah
Baby, that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now
Baby, that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now

Sorry that you didn't get to see me, oh yeah
Sorry you didn't get a chance to feel me, yeah, oh, I'm
Going, going, tryna find you
That's just what it is right now
Baby, that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now
Baby, that's all I can give right now
Maybe that's just what it is right now
Right now2Embed
