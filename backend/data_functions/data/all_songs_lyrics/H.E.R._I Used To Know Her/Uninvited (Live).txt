Uninvited (Live) Lyrics
Hey, hey
Oh

Three times, I've said your name
What you looking at anyways?
You said you needed my company
Well, I'm here now

So can we be open?
Can you hear me knocking on the door?
Feeling unnoticed
You don't pay me attention anymore
Baby, you promised
It'd only be you and me tonight
But now you got me feeling like uninvited

Can't seem to put down your phone
Would you rather be all alone?
I feel like I'm in your way
Let me know

So can we be open?
Can you hear me knocking on the door?
Feeling unnoticed
You don't pay me attention anymore
Baby, you promised
It'd only be you and me tonight
But now you got me feeling like uninvited
Uninvited
Baby, put your phone down
I'll grab my stuff and go now
You wouldn't even notice that
Baby, put your phone, phone down

Uninvited (Uninvited)
Uninvited (Uninvited)
No, uninvited
Can we be open? Open, oh
Uninvited
