Fate Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm
Mmm

I'm lost
Is it really even my fault?
I don't think that it's supposed to be hard
If it's really meant to be
So give me a sign
Is he always gonna be mine?
Have I given it enough of my time?
You cannot blame if it don't mean nothing

Sweet, sweet fate
I had about all I can take
Am I living in the bed that I made?
Is it yours? I wonder
Sweet, sweet fate (Sweet, sweet fate)
Oh if it's really out of my hands (If it's really out of my hands)
Can you forgive all of my sins? (Can you forgive all of my sins?)
Have mercy on me, me

Why me?
If you walked a mile using my feet
You would go a little easy on me
You'd know where I'm coming from, yeah
How come, when I'm lookin' at everyone
They get away with havin' their fun?
I'm paying these dues when they don't mean nothing
Sweet, sweet fate
I had about all I can take
Am I living in the bed that I made?
Is it yours? I wonder
Sweet, sweet fate (Sweet, sweet fate)
Oh if it's really out of my hands (If it's really out of my hands)
Can you forgive all of my sins? (Can you forgive all of my sins?)
Have mercy on me, me5Embed
