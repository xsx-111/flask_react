21 Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

Cold winters, late dinners, and black Sprinters
After-show afterparty, orange juice and Bacardi
I'm old enough, I made enough to move to Abu Dhabi
And who could stop me? Yeah
Old friends, they comment, but where you been?
One fish, two fish, you're all switched
Past tense, back when I wasn't relevant, it's evident (It's evident)

Everybody not made for this life (No, no)
I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm 21 now, oh, I'm 21, yeah
Everybody wanna be my guy (Yeah)
And my girl, too
I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm 21 now, I'm 21 (Yeah)

8 AM, meditate, I'm runnin' late
I'm out the gate, I'm on the way, tell 'em to wait
'Cause it's meetings here, it's people there, they everywhere
They want me to share, no way
Now that we number one, I gotta run, the deal is done
I don't need no sleep, I've been at it over a week
Can't work as hard as me, but wanna eat
Can't cheat the grind
No, everybody not made for this life (No)
I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm 21 now (I'm 21), oh, I'm 21, yeah (Screamin' I'm 21)
Everybody wanna be my guy
And my girl, too
I, I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm 21 now (Yeah), oh, I'm 21

That hype shit won't get you nowhere
That type shit won't get you nowhere
Stop tellin' people that we've been tight
I ain't seen you nowhere
That hype shit won't get you nowhere
And I love when they be thirstin'
I ain't text you back 'cause I was workin'
I be so low-key, they want me
They want me, they want me

Everybody not made for this life (No)
I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm 21 now, uh, oh, I'm 21, yeah, yeah
Everybody wanna be my guy
And my girl, too, yeah
I wouldn't trade it for the world
I'm 21 now, screamin' I'm 21
21, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm made for this
Wouldn't trade it for the world
21 now
They wanna be my guy
And my girl, too, shit
I wouldn't trade it for the world
21 now, 216Embed
