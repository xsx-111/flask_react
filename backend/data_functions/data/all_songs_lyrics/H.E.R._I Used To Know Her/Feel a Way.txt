Feel a Way Lyrics
I'm up, late night, my phone so dry
No goodnight, I'm tight 'cause I'm paranoid
I can't sleep, you're still mad at me
It's not that deep, we been here before

Oh, I hate when you do that shit (Oh)
Please stop bringin' up the past shit (Oh)
Tell me I'm being irrational
You're in your feelings, but all I know is

Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way

Crazy, but you made me like that
2 AM, I thought you was on the way
It's your fault, I played my part
Don't start that talk like you ain't planned to stay
Oh, I hate when you do that shit (Oh)
Now I'm bringin' up the past shit (Oh)
Tell me I'm being irrational
I'm not dealing with you, all I know is

Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way

I've been trying so hard not to go off, but you're trying me
Trying me, yeah
I've been trying so hard not to go off, but you're trying me
Oh, trying me
Donâ€™t make me feel a way

Don't make me feel a way (A way)
Don't make me feel a way (A way)
Don't make me feel a way (A way)
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way (Don't make me feel)
Don't make me feel a way
Don't make me feel a way
Yeah, oh, ooh
Don't make me feel
Don't make me feel
Na na, na na, na4Embed
