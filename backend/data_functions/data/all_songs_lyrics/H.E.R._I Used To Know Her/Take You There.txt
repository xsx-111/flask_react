Take You There Lyrics
Where'd you go?
Who you know?
How I've been living without you
Daydreaming on a cloud with you like horizon
With you 'til the night ends on a island, yeah

It's about time for making up
The times you wasn't with me waking up
Lying if I said I didn't miss your touch
I needed to, I needed to
Needed to distance myself from you
Oh, just to know you were the truth
So come closer, won't you? Won't you?

Can I tell you something, for what it's worth?
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you
Show you something, give you more than words
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you there
Take you there

Fill me up 'til my cup's overflowing
I'm so anxious just to feel the silence
It's so quiet, but I hear you
Saying to me baby
It's about time for making up (Time for making up)
The times you wasn't with me waking up
Lying if I said I didn't miss your touch
I needed to, I needed to
Needed to distance myself from you (You)
Oh, just to know you were the truth (Oh)
So come closer, won't you? Won't you?

Can I tell you something, for what it's worth?
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you
Show you something, give you more than words
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you there, yeah
Take you there

Keep me, please me, don't tease me
Love me, give me that feeling
I want you to give it to me, yeah, yeah
Keep me, please me, don't tease me
Love me, give me that feeling
I want you to give it to me, yeah, yeah
Yeah, woah
Take me high, high4Embed
