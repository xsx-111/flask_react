Against Me Lyrics
Mmm
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Da da, da da)
Oh yeah, uh

I should've listened to my intuition
I put myself in this position
It's all my fault, look in the mirror
Think, "What am I missin'?"

See and think different, oh, am I lost?
Feelin' a way, nothing's the same
I wish you would change, oh, I'm lost
Numbin' the pain don't make it okay
Nothin' to say, but

You brought all the issues (Issues)
And mine was staying with you
Don't hold it against me ('Gainst me)
Against me ('Gainst me)
Hold it against me, against me (Yeah)
And I don't trust you lately
And if that makes me crazy
Can't hold it against me ('Gainst me)
Against me ('Gainst me)
Hold it against me (Yeah), yeah (Oh)
Feel like I'm driftin'
Know he notice the distance
And love ain't been blockin' my vision
But that ain't my fault (My fault)
That he was the difference
You let him get in that position

I'm too comfortable now
Ain't feelin' a way, nothing's the same
I think every day that we're lost, yeah
And love ain't enough, but it's holdin' me up
Love ain't enough 'cause

You brought all the issues (Yeah)
And mine was staying with you (Staying with you)
Don't hold it against me ('Gainst me)
Against me ('Gainst me)
Hold it against me, against me
And I don't trust you lately (Say I don't trust you)
And if that makes me crazy (If that makes me)
Can't hold it against me ('Gainst me)
Against me (Yeah, yeah)
Hold it against me ('Gainst me), yeah ('Gainst me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh, oh, yeah (Against me)
To my women with the utmost respect, intellect
We often forget and neglect
Intuition can see through illsive intent, listen to it
(Just listen, just listen, oh)
I found myself searching for a way to prevent, the detriment
And giving the impression that if you express to him what a woman needs, his comprehension is definite
But there's a difference between understanding and honoring your word
And I'm articulate, he's a good listener
But I'm hesitant 'cause he's gonna fuck up anyways
(Baby just listen, listen, listen, oh)
In the corners of a man's mind
There's a place where vulnerability hides
And intimacy is not the act of physical intertwine
But it's the isolation of two minds
That's why he keeps his heart and his head separate
There's only one he can connect with
The multiple names on the checklist
Only calls when he's desperate
I guess it's too much pressure to be respectful and honest
It's too stressful to be keepin' promises and I'm impatient
I'm too high maintenance
Way too many expectations when we're just dating
But I'm special, right?
Deny, deny, deny
All you do is lie, word is bond, right?
But not with me because I don't know what it's like
I'll never understand the needs of a man or how to nurture
And what she doesn't know can't hurt her
But nah, it's deep and you know it
I told you exactly what I wanted
And that love is exhausting, but I'm not tired of you yet
(Oh, no, woah, no)
To my women with the utmost respect, intellect
We often forget and neglect
Intuition can see through illusive intent, listen to it7Embed
