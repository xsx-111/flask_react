Something Keeps Pulling Me Back Lyrics
I know what's wrong, I know what's right
I see the truth, but I stay blind
I say I'm fine, but I know there's no hope inside
Can't even take my own advice
Even though you've been showing signs
Maybe you go your way and so will I

Now I'm sitting in a car that I won't start
Maybe I got too much to say right now
Like I'm paralyzed from the waist down
Why is it so hard?

'Cause every time I try to leave
Something keep pulling me back
Every time I try to leave
Something keep pulling me back
I know, I know better
But something just won't let up, let up
Every time I try to leave
Something keep pulling me back
Yeah

Was it a fight we never had?
Was there a good in all the bad?
Is it enough for me to never want to come back? Oh yeah
Maybe I'm running from a truth
But baby, I blame it all on you
It's really me, but all my pride would never say that
So I'm sitting in a car that I won't start (Won't start)
Maybe I got nothing to say right now
Like I'm paralyzed from the waist down
Why is it so hard?

'Cause every time I try to leave
Something keep pulling me back
Every time I try to leave
Something keep pulling me back
I know, I know better (Better)
But something just won't let up, let up
Every time I try to leave
Something keep pulling me back

Every time I try to leave
Something keep pulling me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Mmm, yeah
Every time I try to leave
Something keep pulling me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Need you in my life2Embed
