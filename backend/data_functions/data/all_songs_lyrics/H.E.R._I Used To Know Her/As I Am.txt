As I Am Lyrics
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ooh

It's like the morning time
Don't wanna wake up, I
Just wanna stay in bed
But if I'm next to you
I'm lookin' forward to
Just layin' in this bed

Ooh, that never gets old
Promise you'll never let go
I don't want no one else
So we should be chillin' back
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
So tell me that, tell me that

Tell me I'm the best, aw, yeah
I'll be feelin' like, yes, I am, I am
You know I'm the best, aw, yeah
Be a fool to not take me as I am, I am
Tell me I'm the best, aw, yeah
I'll be feelin' like, yes, I am, I am
You know I'm the best, aw, yeah
You'd be a fool to not take me as I am
You're like the sweetest thing I know
Like my favorite Lauryn song
And I need you really bad, oh yeah
Don't take me for granted
You'll be regretting it
Oh, I should be your last, oh yeah

Ooh, that never gets old
Promise you'll never let go
Grass ain't green nowhere else
So we should be chillin' back
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
So tell me that, tell me that

Tell me I'm the best, aw, yeah (Aw, yeah)
I'll be feelin' like, yes, I am, I am
You know I'm the best, aw, yeah
Be a fool to not take me as I am
Tell me I'm the best, aw, yeah
I'll be feelin' like, yes, I am, I am
You know I'm the best, aw, yeah
You'd be a fool to not take me as I am (I am)
I am, I am
Take me, take me
Oh, hey, yeah

Tell me I'm the best, aw, yeah (Aw, yeah)
I'll be feelin' like, yes, I am, I am
You know I'm the best, aw, yeah
You'd be a fool to not take me as I am
Tell me I'm the best, aw, yeah
I'll be feelin' like, yes, I am, I am
You know I'm the best, aw, yeah
You'd be a fool to not take me as I am11Embed
