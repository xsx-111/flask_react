Hard Place (Single Version) Lyrics
Mmh, mmh, mmh, mmh, yeah

Wanna believe what you say
But I hate you on most days
You've been testing my faith and my patience, yeah
And you know that I be headstrong
But you know that you be dead wrong
Telling me to relax when I'm reacting

But I, I'd rather fight
Than lose sleep at night
At least you're all mine
And if I have to choose
My heart or you
I'm gonna lose, yeah

What if nothing ever will change?
Oh, I'm caught between your love and a hard place
Oh, I wish there was a right way
I'm caught between your love and a hard place, oh
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, woah
Do I even have a choice when
I'm gonna have to pick my poison?
Yeah, you hurt me so good, it's so good
And even when you cause tears
You're the one who wipe them away
Maybe that's the reason I stay, I stay

And if I have to choose
My heart or you, I'm gonna lose

What if nothing ever will change?
Oh, I'm caught between your love and a hard place
Oh, I wish there was a right way
I'm caught between your love and a hard place, oh
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, woah

Ooh, I wish there was a right way, yeah
I'm caught between your love and a hard place, oh-woah
Woah, woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, woah
(I'm caught between your love and a hard place)
What if nothing will ever change?
I'm caught between your love and a hard place2Embed
