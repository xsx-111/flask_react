Carried Away Lyrics
Stare out the window
Oh, why am I so
Jaded and waiting for some kinda miracle? Yeah
Love doesn't live here
And I've cried enough tears
Sorry if I can't imagine that you care, oh

Please
I never saw it coming
You wanna take me away
So please
Don't let it be for nothing
Before we get carried away, yeah

Ain't my fault I'm guarded
I'm good, I've been okay
Fronting, I don't wanna be loved anyway
And that's why I do as I say
'Cause I had a bad case
Losing a game I never wanted to play, oh

Please
I never saw it coming
You wanna take me away
So please
Don't let it be for nothing
Before we get carried away, yeah
Before we cross the line
I, I don't wanna take my chances if this ain't it, oh no
If you're not sure, then let me go, ooh

Please
I never saw it coming
You wanna take me away
So please
Don't let it be for nothing
Before we get carried away
Before we get carried away, yeah5Embed
