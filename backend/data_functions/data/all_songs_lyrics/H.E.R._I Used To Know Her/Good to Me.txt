Good to Me Lyrics
Mmm, oh
Little faster

Wanna try, I wanna thrive
Not just survive, no fakin'
And every night when it's feelin' right
Feel like you're livin' lies and now I'm breakin'

But I cannot stay
And I'm not okay
All on my own
You got to be good to me
Please give me peace
And make me believe
That I'm not alone
You got to be good to me, me
You got to be good

It's 3 AM, I gotta know (Gotta know)
Where were you? I been waitin'
I let it go, but prove me wrong
Oh, something's off, am I crazy?
I cannot stay
But I'm not okay
All on my own
You got to be good to me
Please give me peace
And make me believe
That I'm not alone
You got to be good to me
You got to be good to me (Be good)
You got to be good

Don't know what I'm chasin'
I can't erase what I'm feelin' deep inside
Oh, but I

I cannot stay
But I'm not okay
All on my own
You got to be good to me
Please give me peace
And make me believe
That I'm not alone
You got to be good to me (Be good)
You got to be good to me (Be)
You got to be good to me (Got to be good)
Be good to me, baby
Got to be
Got to be
Do we have enough?
Uh, what did I say?
I'ma just write down shit and then...
I know for a fact you said "warmth" and "unconditional love"
Alright, okay, so what if...
In the beginning, I'm saying...
In my eyes, you're a combination of
The kindness and compassion of my mother
And the warmth and—what did I say?
Warmth and unconditional love of my father
And when we're together, this and that, and I feel this
And the way that you treat me is this
And I feel, I feel, I, it takes me back to this
And, and that feeling is good, but are you really good to me?
And then it's...
Who are you when I'm not around? Is it the same?
That's fire
Are you... basically, like if we could say it in a cool way
Like, do you act like you're single when it's not us two?
You know? Like that kind of thing, you know what I'm saying?
Like, really kind of dig in and make this story, like, set up in a way that's like "oh shit"
Do I get that? I'm recording, right? Do I...
Is it, is it deceit? You know? Or is it, is it real? But only when...
Is it real... is it real around me and to the world you, you fake something?
You know?
Right
And... 'cause some people... some people aren't really...
Some people aren't really, um, bad people
But they feel like they have to be, you know?
Right
To get even deeper into it
Like, I think some men were raised a certain way
But they get around other kind of men and get insecure
And feel like they have to be that way
You know what I'm saying?
Like, they have to be that way or they feel like
"Okay, this is how I'm gonna...
This is the way it's supposed to be because my boys told me that"
You know?
So I think it's kind of like the other perspective of not, like
Coming from a woman who's with a man that's no good
But it's a man that is good to me
But you have be good to me when I'm not around
And you have to think of who you really want to be
Right
Ah, la, la, la, you got to be good to me
Yeah, anyway
Had to dig into it real quick
What did I say?4Embed
