Matamoros LyricsNow that the blood has begun
I'd like to see how it's done
Behind my back, up to my face
Let's take the money and run
Before you go for that, son
You better think about luck
While you're debating, I'll be waiting
For the sound of a bomb
If my desire for your company
Made this motherfucker point his gun at me
Every complication, every little crime that you hide
I will find if you ever do change your mind

I'm over you, I'll tell you why
Your kiss is poison and your castoff ways defined
I'll cut you down, I'll stitch you up
You played with fire with me
They say that fate is a card
And that the sun is a star
I'm throwin' shade, we got it made
I think I'll have a cigar
I got a number for it
There ain't no way it can fit
I'm so excited you decided
To come over and beg
I'm over you, I'll tell you why
Your kiss is poison and your castoff ways defined
I'll cut you down, I'll stitch you up
You played with fire with me
Baby, I'm over you, I'll tell you why
Your kiss is poison and your castoff ways defined
I'll cut you down, I'll stitch you up
You played with fire with meEmbed
