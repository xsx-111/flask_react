These Sticks LyricsFrom shallow breathing
A different storm begins
Misplaced your feelings?
Well, that ain't your problem now
You thought me easy
And ripe for punishing the dead
Can't stop the bleeding
It all starts coming round again
Tie these stick around my heart
Be here when it blows apart
This ain't love but let's pretend
That it's easy, easy
To forget
In dreams you're hunted
Around and round we go
And this is why we're coming
And this is how you'll know
If I seem impatient
You won't be waiting long, my friend
Tie these stick around my heart
Be here when it blows apart
This ain't love but let's pretend
That it's easy, easy
Easy, baby
Easy, baby
Easy, baby
Tie these stick around my heart
Be there when it blows apart
This ain't love but let's pretend
That it's easy, easy, baby
Easy, baby
Once I fell in your remand
Spent so where I could not stand
Bent to suffer at your hand
Your command
You thought me easy
You thought me prey
I've come to meet you
I've come to make you payEmbed
