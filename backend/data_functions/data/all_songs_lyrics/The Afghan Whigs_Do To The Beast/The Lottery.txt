The Lottery LyricsLet it be light, baby, where there's none
Memories bite, baby, never done
I control, collect, collide
Come in slow, but that's alright
Let it be night, baby, come undone
Let it be night, baby, watch them run
The enemy lies waiting for the sun
I control, collect, collide
To let go is to bet your life
Let it be light, baby, 'til there's none
The lottery, the ritual
The consequence, the criminal
Come back to me, I've been them all
Come bedtime, come bad times
Let it be night then I'm born again
Remedy disguise the poison pen
You let her slip out of the tourniquet again
The lottery
Still waiting for the show
A part of me can't let it go
I'll fade to black, a parable
Incognizant, incomparable
And now we've reached the end
One for now
One for always
One for me
One for yourself
I'm ready
I'm ready
