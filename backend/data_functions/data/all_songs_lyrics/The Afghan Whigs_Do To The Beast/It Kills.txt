It Kills LyricsOver and over I get to know myself
Over and over there ain't nobody else
Imperceptible the lines I draw to you
It kills to watch you love another
I should have known better
When I caught you wild
You were incredible
Never knew you like I know you now
You are illegible
Imperceptible the lines that form the screw
It kills to watch you love another
Over and over I get to know myself
Over and over there ain't nobody else
A receptacle of lies, construed to waste your time
It kills to watch you love another
Over and over I get to know myself
Over and over there ain't nobody else
A receptacle, the lies construed to waste your time
It kills to watch you love another
It kills to watch you love another
It kills to watch you love anotherEmbed
