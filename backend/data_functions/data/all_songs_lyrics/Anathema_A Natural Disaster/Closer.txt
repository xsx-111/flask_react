Closer LyricsYour dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
To be trapped in...
Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
To be trapped inside, trapped inside, trapped inside....all your life
Shine in time
Shine in time
Shine in time
Until you find you're closer, you're closer, you're closer, to the truth
Within you, within you, within you....is the truth
Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
To be trapped in...
Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
To be trapped inside, trapped inside, trapped inside....all your life
Shine in time
Shine in time
Shine in time
Until you find you're closer, you're closer, you're closer, to the truth
Within you, within you, within you....is the truthEmbed
