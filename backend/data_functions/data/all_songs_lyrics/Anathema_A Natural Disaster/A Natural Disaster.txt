A Natural Disaster Lyrics
It's been a long cold winter without you
I've been crying on the inside over you
Just slipped through my fingers as life turned away
It's been a long cold winter since that day

It's hard to find
Hard to find
Hard to find the strength now but I try
And I don't want to
Don't want to
Don't want to go on and speak now
Of what's gone by
Cos no matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened

You just slipped through my fingers
And I feel so ashamed
You just slipped through my fingers
And I have paid
Cause no matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
No matter what I say
No matter what I do
I can't change what happened
No no I can't change
