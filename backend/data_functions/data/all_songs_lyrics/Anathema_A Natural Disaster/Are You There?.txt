Are You There? LyricsAre you there?
Is it wonderful to know
All the ghosts...
All the ghosts...
Freak my selfish out
My mind is happy
Need to learn to let it go
I know you'd do no harm to me
But since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
And I wish you could see the love in her eyes
The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind
But what can I say now?
It couldn't be more wrong cause there's no one there
Unmistakably lost and without a care
Did we lose all the love that we could have shared?
And its wearing me down
And its turning me round
And I can't find a way now to find it out
Where are you when I need you?
Are you there?4Embed
