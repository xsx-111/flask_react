Bamboo Lyrics
You take a stick of bamboo
You take a stick of bamboo
You take a stick of bamboo
You throw it in the water
Oh, oh, Hanaah

You take a stick of bamboo
You take a stick of bamboo
You take a stick of bamboo
You throw it in the water
Oh, oh, Hanaah

River, she come down
River, she come down

You travel on the river
You travel on the river
You travel on the river
You travel on the water
Oh, oh, Hanaah

You travel on the river
You travel on the river
You travel on the river
You travel on the water
Oh, oh, Hanaah
River, she come down
River, she come down

My home's across the river
My home's across the river
My home's across the river
My home's across the water
Oh, oh, Hanaah

My home's across the river
My home's across the river
My home's across the river
My home's across the water
Oh, oh, Hanaah

River, she come down
River, she come down

You take a stick of bamboo
You take a stick of bamboo
You take a stick of bamboo
You throw it in the waterEmbed
