If I Had My Way Lyrics
You read about Sampson, you read about his birth
He was the strongest man that ever lived on Earth
One day Sampson was walking alone
He looked down on the ground and he saw an old jawbone
He lifted up that jawbone and he swung it over his head
And when he got to moving ten thousand was dead

If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down

Sampson and the lion got in attack
Sampson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion - he killed a man with his paw
(Had my way, had my way)
Sampson he got his hands around the lion's jaw
(Had my way, had my way)
And he ripped that beast 'til the lion was dead
(Had my way, had my way)
And the bees made honey in the lion's head
(Had my way, had my way)

If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down
Delilah she was a woman, she was fine and fair (Yeah)
She had lovely looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she climbed up on Sampson's knee
(Had my way, well if I had my way, well if I)
She said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
(Had my way, well if I had my way, well if I)
She talked so fine, she talked so fair
(Had my way, well if I had my way, well if I)
Sampson said "Delilah, cut off my hair
(Had my way, well if I had my way, well)
Shave my head as clean as your hand
(Had my way, if I had my way)
And my strength will be like a natural man."
(Had my way, had my way)

If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down, yeah!Embed
