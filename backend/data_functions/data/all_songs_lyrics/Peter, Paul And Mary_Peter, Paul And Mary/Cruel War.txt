Cruel War Lyrics
The cruel war is raging, Johnny has to fight
I want to be with him from morning 'til night
I want to be with him, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

Tomorrow is Sunday, Monday is the day
That your Captain will call you and you must obey
Your captain will call you, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

I'll tie back my hair, men's clothing I'll put on
I'll pass as your comrade as we march along
I'll pass as your comrade, no one will ever know
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

Oh Johnny, oh Johnny, I fear you are unkind
I love you far better than all of mankind
I love you far better than words can e're express
Won't you let me go with you?
Yes, my love, yes
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Yes, my love, yesEmbed
