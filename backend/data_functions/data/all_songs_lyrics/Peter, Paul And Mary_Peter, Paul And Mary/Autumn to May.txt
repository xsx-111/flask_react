Autumn to May Lyrics
Oh once I had a little dog
His color it was brown
I taught him for to whistle
To sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long
His ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day
Upon him I could ride

Sing tarry-o day
Sing autumn to May

Oh once I had a little frog
He wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane
A top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places
Of things to see and do
And all the kings and queens he'd met
While sailing in a shoe

Sing tarry-o day
Sing autumn to May
Oh once I had a flock of sheep
They grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box
From wind or rainy weather
And every day the sun would shine
They'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings
Candy by the pound

Sing tarry-o day
Sing autumn to May

Oh once I had a downey swan
She was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell
And hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird
The bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale
Would have to tell a lie

Sing tarry-o day
Sing autumn to MayEmbed
