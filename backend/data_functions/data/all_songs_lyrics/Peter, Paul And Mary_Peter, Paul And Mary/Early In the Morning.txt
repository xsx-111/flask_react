Early In the Morning Lyrics
Well early in the morning, about the break of day
I ask the Lord, "Help me find the way"
Help me find the way to the promised land
This lonely body needs a helping hand
I ask the Lord to help me please find the way

When the new day's a dawning, I bow my head in prayer
I pray to the Lord, "Won't you lead me there?"
Won't you guide me safely to the Golden Stair?
Won't you let this body your burden share?
I pray to the Lord, "Won't you lead me please, lead me there?"

When the judgment comes to find the world in shame
When the trumpet blows won't you call my name?
When the thunder rolls and the heavens rain
When the sun turns black, never shine again
When the trumpet blows, won't you call me please, call my nameEmbed
