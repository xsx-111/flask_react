Getaway LyricsWhat's it like up there?
Do you worry anymore?
How's it feel up there?
So much left to say
If I could tell your thoughts right now
It would never be the same
Wait till I am by your side
Then the meaning will come true
You're love will find a better way
Everybody wants you to know
You're love will find a better way
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody wants you to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody, everybody wants to know
We are nearly there
Do you get to see the love?
Can you understand my thoughts?
Seeing as no-one else here can
When you see the light
Does your pain just disappear?
Will I ever feel your love
Once again my dear?
Your love will find a better way
Everybody wants you to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody wants you to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody, everybody wants to know
What's it like up there?
How's it feel up there?
What's it like up there?
How's it feel up there?
Your love will find a better way
Everybody wants you to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody wants you to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody wants you to know
Yourlove will find a better way
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody wants you to know
Your love will find a better way
Everybody, everybody wants to knowEmbed
