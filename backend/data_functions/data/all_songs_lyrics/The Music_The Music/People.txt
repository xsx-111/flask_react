People LyricsHey Monday morning
See what you're missing
I can't live my life like this boy
I said hey little lady
See what you're missing
I can't get enough of your love

She goes
Out all alone and out on her own
How many times do
I have to say this
Your match is a light for me babe
I said hey little lady
See what you're missing
I can't get enough of your love

All alone 
The people 
Change the way you live now
The people 
Change the way you live now
Hey Monday morning
See what you're missing
I can't live my life like this boy
I said hey little lady
See what you're missing
I can't get enough of your love

All alone 
The people 
Change the way you live now
The people 
Change the way you live nowEmbed
