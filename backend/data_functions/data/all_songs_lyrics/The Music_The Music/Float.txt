Float LyricsWe're so nearly
You wanna get where we are
You love me
Love me
Love me
Love me yeah
I wanna be where you're love is higher
People getaway from this love which is mine
I want to be free
Want to be free
You wanna be free
Wanna be free
You wanna be free
Wanna be free
You wanna be free
In my insecurity (oh ooh oh)
In my insecurity (oh ooh oh)
You want this love
You want it so
Not emo
Not emo
Not emo
Not emotion yeah
I wanna be where the sun shoots higher
People getaway from this love that is mine
You want to be free
Want to be free
You wanna be free
Wanna be free
You wanna be free
Wanna be free
You wanna be free
In my insecurity
In my insecurity
Yeah in my insecurity
In my insecurity
Bah bah bah bah bah yeah
Bah bah bah bah bah yeah
Bah bah bah bah bah yeah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah yeah
Love is here
We float
Time is not here now
Lost
When you hit the ground
Feeling to float
My ship is stuck here
Feeling to float
My ship is stuck here
Feeling to float
My ship is stuck here
Feeling to float
My ship is stuck here
Feeling to float
Love in my boat
Feeling to float
Love in my boat
Feeling to float
Show me your love
Feeling to float
Love in my boat
Love in my boat
Feeling to float
Love in my boatEmbed
