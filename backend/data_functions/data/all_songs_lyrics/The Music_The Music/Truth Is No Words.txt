Truth Is No Words LyricsPeople try to judge me
They remember the old me
All I know is all I own
Everybody moving
Set the rhythm grooving
Send The Rhythm through me
Well I don't know what I'm gonna be
Everybody wants me to be free
Everybody get down to the beat
The the the the the truth truth truth truth truth is is is no words
You can. You know what it's for
But right now, fuck it yeah
Well I've been around some time
And I don't know what I'm doing
And now everybody's prayin'
Well I don't know what I'm gonna be
Everybody wants me to be free
Everybody get down to the beat
The the the the the truth truth truth truth truth is is is no words
You can. You know what it's for
Diddly dumb dumb dumb here I come
I don't know what I'm gonna find
Won't somebody help me?Embed
