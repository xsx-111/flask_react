Turn Out The Light LyricsTurn out the light
Tell me a story
Does it feel right
We all hate our own lives
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
How does it feel
When im not there
Does it feel right
If he doesnt care
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
YOU ONLY GET
What you are given
Now his time is up
Used to see
Watch this love fall down
Do you feel it
Well his time is up
You to see
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Turn out the light
Tell me a story
Does it feel right
We all hate our own lives
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
Baby baby baby baby ba ba ba yeah
