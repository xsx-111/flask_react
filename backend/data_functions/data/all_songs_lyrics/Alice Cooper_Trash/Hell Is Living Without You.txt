Hell Is Living Without You LyricsI can't find your face
In a thousand masqueraders
You're hidden in the colors
Of a million other lost charaders
In life's big parade
I'm the loneliest spectator
'Cause you're gone without a trace
In a sea of faceless imitators
I can't take another night
Burning inside this
Hell is living without your
Love ain't nothing without your
Touch me, heaven would be like
Hell is living without you
Try to walk away
When I see the time I've wasted
Starving at a feast
And all this wine I've never tasted
On my lips your memory
Has been stained
Is it all in vain
Tell me who's to blame
I can't take another night
Burning inside this
Hell is living without your
Love ain't nothing without your
Touch me, heaven would be like
Hell is living without you
Nights get longer and colder
I'm down begging to hold ya
On my own and I feel like
Hell is living without you
Hell is living without your
Love ain't nothing without your
Touch me, heaven would be like
Hell is living without you
Nights get longer and colder
I'm down begging to hold ya
On my own and I feel like
Hell is living without you1Embed
