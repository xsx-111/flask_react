Save You Lyrics
I can tell, I can tell how much you hate this
And deep down inside, you know it's killin' me
I can call, wish you well, and try to change this
But nothin' I can say would change anything
Where were my senses?
I left them all behind
Why did I turn away?
Away

I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not goin' nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Didn't mean, didn't mean to leave you stranded
Went away 'cause I didn't wanna face the truth
Reachin' out, reach for me empty handed
You don't know if I care, you're tryin' to find the proof
There were times I'd wonder: "Could I have eased your pain?"
Why did I turn away?
Away
I wish I could save you
I wish I could say to you
I'm not goin' nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
Save you (It's gonna be alright)
I wish I could save you

We can pretend nothing's changed
Pretend it's all the same
And there will be no pain tonight
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Save you (It's gonna be alright)
I wish I could save you
I'm not goin' nowhere
I wish I could say to you
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
Save you (It's gonna be alright)
I wish I could save you
It's gonna be alright1Embed
