The Day We Fell Apart Lyrics
Let's go
Whoa, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah

What happened to the man who used to take me
Straight into misery?
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me
How could this be?

Tell me, what's this desperation?
'Cause I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
It's more than I can take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (-Part, part, part, part)
Now everything is coming undone
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart
Whoa, oh, oh
I must admit the grass is so much greener
On the other side
Since you left, I noticed now you're so much meaner
And it's something I think I like

Tell me, what's this desperation?
'Cause I don't recognize these chains
I think I made a bad mistake

('Cause once I ran away) 'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
It's more than I can take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (-Part, part, part, part)
Now everything is coming undone
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart

I made a bad mistake
Used to pray for space
Drowning you one more time
Amend my wicked ways
'Cause once I ran away
I loved you since the day
The day I broke your heart (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
It's more than I can take
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart (-Part, part, part, part)
Now everything is coming undone
'Cause you were the chance I can't afford to waste
I loved you since the day
The day we fell apart
The day we fell apart

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, yeahEmbed
