If No One Will Listen Lyrics
Maybe no one told you
There is strength in your tears
And so you fight to keep from pouring out
But what if you unlock the gate that keeps your secret soul?
Do you think that there's enough you might drown?

If no one will listen
If you decide to speak
If no one is left
Standing after the bombs explode
If no one wants to look at you
For what you really are
I will be here still

No one can tell you where you alone must go
There's no telling what you'll find there
And God, I know the fear eats away at your bones
Screaming every step, "Just stay here"

If no one will listen
If you decide to speak
If no one is left
Standing after the bombs explode
If no one wants to look at you
For what you really are
I will be here still
If you find your fists are raw and red from beating yourself down
If your legs have given out under the weight
If you find that you've been settling for a world of gray
So you wouldn't have to face down your own hate

If no one will listen
If you decide to speak
If no one is left
Standing after the bombs explode
If no one wants to look at you
For what you really are
I will be here still
If no one will listen
If you decide to speak
If no one is left
Standing after the bombs explode
If no one wants to look at you
For what you really are
I will be here still
I will be here stillEmbed
