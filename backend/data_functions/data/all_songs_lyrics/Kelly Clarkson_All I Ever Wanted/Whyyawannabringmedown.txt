Whyyawannabringmedown Lyrics
This situation, if it gets any deeper, could be critical
I'm not your love monkey, so be takin' back all of the lies you sold
What did you want me to be? Yeah
It's just too much now, so tell me, so tell me, so tell me
One, two, three, four

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spendin' my time pleasing you?
Why must you keep me underground?
Tell me, tell me whyyawannabringmedown
Is that too much to give a damn?
When I'm givin' you one hundred and ten
Don't blink 'cause I won't be around
Tell me, so tell me whyyawannabringmedown

Now your transmission is on the negative, you're on a losin' streak
This information is getting ordinary and you're losin' me
What's with your hostility?
Oh, when the lights on me
When you're down to the last chance
So tell me, so tell me, so tell me
Uno, Dos, Tres, Quatro
So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spendin' my time pleasing you?
Why must you keep me underground?
Tell me, tell me whyyawannabringmedown
Is that too much to give a damn?
When I'm givin' you one hundred and ten
Don't blink 'cause I won't be around
Tell me, so tell me whyyawannabringmedown

Down (Bring me down)
Ooh, yeah
Bring me down
Ooh, yeah

Was it all just a waste of time?
Well, I don't wanna spend my whole life thinkin' 'bout it
Baby, this is where I draw the line
I think I'm done
SOMEBODY!

So what's your evil attitude
When you got me spendin' my time pleasing you?
Why must you keep me underground?
Tell me, tell me whyyawannabringmedown
Is that too much to give a damn?
When I'm givin' you one hundred and ten
Don't blink 'cause I won't be around
Tell me, so tell me whyyawannabringmedown
Down, yeah
Whyyawannabringmedown
Oh, yeah
Tell me, tell me whyyawannabringmedown
Down, down, down
Whyyawannabringmedown
Whyyawanna, whyyawanna, whyyawannabringmedown2Embed
