Can We Go Back Lyrics
You're complicating things
I need some room to breathe
I gotta get back to simplicity
If you want more than this
Then tell me what it is I gotta do
Oh, this is killing me
I need you to see that something's gotta change

Can we go back to the way we used to be?
Back to the butterflies, staring deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be?
When living and loving was easy
We gotta find a way to fool reality
Can we go back to the way we used to be?

When did we mess it up? What happened to love?
We had it good, but it wasn't enough
We shouldn't let it fade all the way
We're over thinking this way too much
I want you next to me, but something's gotta change

Can we go back to the way we used to be?
Back to the butterflies, staring deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be?
When living and loving was easy
We gotta find a way to fool reality
Can we go back to the way we used to be?
Can we go back?
Can we go back to the way?
Can we go back?
Can we go back to the way we used to be?
Can we go back?

Oh, I'm getting tired of the fight
We can't pretend that it's alright
I'm slowly losing hope
Baby, can we try?

Can we go back to the way we used to be?
Back to the butterflies, staring deep in your eyes
Can we go back to how we used to be?
When living and loving was easy
We gotta find a way to fool reality
Can we go back?
We gotta find a way to fool reality
Can we go back?
We gotta find a way to fool reality
Can we go back to the way we used to be?Embed
