Cry Lyrics
If anyone asks, I'll tell them we both just moved on
When people all stare, I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk
Whenever I see you, I'll swallow my pride and bite my tongue
Pretend I'm okay with it all, act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry

If anyone asks, I'll tell them we just grew apart
(I'll ell them we just grew apart)
Yeah, what do I care if they believe me or not?
(If they believe me or not)
Whenever I feel your memory is breaking my heart
I'll pretend I'm okay with it all, act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry
I'm talkin' in circles, I'm lyin', they know it
Why won't this just all go away?

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really cry?
Cry
