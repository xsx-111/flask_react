Long Shot Lyrics
Ah-ah-ah

I felt it, the wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter, I never saw it coming
I started to black out and then someone said good mornin'
I took it as a warning, I should've seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on this thing we may have started
Intentional or not I don't think we saw it coming
It's all addin' up to something
That asks for some involvement, that asks for a commitment
I think I see it comin' if we stepped out on that limb

My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take a long shot
I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming, throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing into this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming 'til it's much too close to stop

My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
So take a long shot

Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming, but we'll make it
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance, no chance
'Cause you're the best I got
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it (So take a long shot)
It's a long shot just to beat these odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it (You didn't expect this)
It's a long shot, but I say why not (Oh, you never saw me coming)
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it (You didn't expect this)
It's a long shot just to beat these odds (Oh, you never saw me coming)
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it
It's a long shot, but I say why notEmbed
