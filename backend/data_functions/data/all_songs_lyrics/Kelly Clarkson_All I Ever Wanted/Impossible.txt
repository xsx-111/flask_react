Impossible Lyrics
Spoke up and thought I'd try
Try to step across the line
You know that I've been thinkin' 'bout it for a while, yeah
Startin' to think it's time I kneel
Does me good to know I finally feel
Feel this pain, it's real, it's possible, you say

Can't change the winds, you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible (It's impossible)
Can't rise above this place, won't change your mind, so I pray
Breakin' down the walls, do the impossible (Impossible)

Walkin' by myself I know
This lonely road's becomin' my new home
But I don't stop, I just keep movin' on, and on
Ain't no need to dry my eyes
I haven't cried in quite some time
Every day I fight it, you know it's possible, you say

Can't change the winds, you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible (It's impossible)
Can't rise above this place, won't change your mind, so I pray
Breakin' down the walls, do the impossible (Impossible)
Can someone tell me why it's so hard takin' chances?
You draw the line and think that I won't ask for more, yeah
I will stumble and I'll make my own mistakes, yeah
But I won't worry 'bout it anymore, it's impossible

Can't change the winds, you say
Won't matter anyway
Can't reach that far 'cause it's impossible (It's impossible)
Can't rise above this place, won't change your mind, so I pray
Breakin' down the walls, do the impossible (Impossible)

It's impossible to you, not impossible for me
Not impossible for me

Can't rise above this place, won't change your mind, so I pray
(It's impossible to you, not impossible for me)
Breaking down the walls, do the impossible
(Not impossible for me)

Spoke up and though I'd try
Try to step across the line2Embed
