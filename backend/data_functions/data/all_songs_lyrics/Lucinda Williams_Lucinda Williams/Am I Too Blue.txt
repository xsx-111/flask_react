Am I Too Blue LyricsAm I too blue for you?
Am I too blue?
When I cry like the sky
Like the sky sometime
Am I too blue?
Is the night too black?
Is the wind too rough?
Is it at your back?
Have you had enough?
Do you miss my touch?
Do you wanna stay?
Do you have so much
Still left to say?
Am I too blue for you?
Am I too blue?
When I cry like the sky
Like the sky somethime
Am I too blue?
When you're in the dark
Do you call my name?
Is there still a spark?
Does it feel the same?
The sun beats down
It burns your skin
When you run into my arms againEmbed
