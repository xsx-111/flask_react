I Asked For Water (He Gave Me Gasoline) LyricsI asked him for water, he gave me gasoline
I asked him for water, gave to me gasoline
I asked him for water, but he gave me gasoline
I went down to the depot, looked up on the board
I went down to the depot, looked up on the board
Saw that train a-running, but I could not get on board
I asked the conductor, can I ride the blinds?
I asked the conductor, can I ride the blinds?
Said, "Girl, buy your ticket, buy your ticket 'cause this train ain't none of mine"
I asked him for water, he gave me gasoline
I asked him for water, gave me gasoline
I asked him for water, but he gave me gasolineEmbed
