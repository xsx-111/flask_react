Like A Rose LyricsIt's okay, you don't have to be afraid
There's nothing to worry about 'cause we got it made
It's just a simple matter of letting me into love
If you let that feeling come over you
Then there's nothing more that you can do
Just let it go, let it go
If it's love you want, hold out your arms
It's alright here, it's safe and warm
It's okay to feel good, that's the way it should be
Everything we have is fresh and new
I will open myself up to you
Like a rose, like a rose
Everything we have is fresh and new
I will open myself up to you
Like a rose, like a roseEmbed
