Big Red Sun Blues LyricsEverything is going wrong
It's not right anymore
We can't seem to get along
The way we did before
Sun is hanging in the sky
Sinking low and so am I
Just for the love of someone
And a big red sun

How'm I gonna lose
These big red sun blues
Big red sun big red sun
Big red sun blues
True love to hold
Is worth everything
It's worth more than gold
Or any diamond ring
But this little diamond
And a heart that's been broken
Are all I got from you
Big red sun

Look out at that western sky
Out over the open plains
God only knows why
This is all that remains
But give me one more promise
And another kiss
And I guess the deal's still on
You big red sun
