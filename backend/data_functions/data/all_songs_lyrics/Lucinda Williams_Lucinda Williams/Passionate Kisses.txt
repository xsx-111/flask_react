Passionate Kisses LyricsIs it too much to ask?
I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
Food to fill me up
And warm clothes and all that stuff
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses (Woah)
Passionate kisses from you?
Is it much to demand?
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses (Woah)
Passionate kisses from you?
Do I want too much?
Am I going overboard to want that touch?
I shouted out to the night
"Give me what I deserve, 'cause it's my right!"
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses (Woah)
Passionate kisses from you?
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses (Woah)
Passionate kisses from youEmbed
