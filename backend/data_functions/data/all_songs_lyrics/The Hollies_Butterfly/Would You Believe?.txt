Would You Believe? LyricsDon't laugh in my face
You're making me feel small
I'm all rags wrapped in lace
Compared with you I'm nothing
Would you believe I'm in love with you?
Would you believe I'm in love
And I can't help myself?
I once tried to touch you
But I could never reach your height
You're way above me
It seems so useless somehow
Would you believe I'm in love with you?
Would you believe I'm in love
And I can't help myself?
Wandering around
With this maddening obsession you have over me
Just wandering around
Oblivious to everything that's going on
One thought in my mind
Keeps pounding through my brain
I've got to make you see how I love you
My life is yours; I live for you
And I can't help myself
Would you believe I'm in love with you?
Would you believe I'm in love
And I can't help myself?
Would you believe I'm in love with you?
Would you believe I'm in love?
Would you believe I'm in love with you?
Would you believe I'm in love?Embed
