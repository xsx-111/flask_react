Step Inside LyricsSide, step inside
You can knock on my door anytime you're passing by
You don't need an invitation, step inside
We'll have tea and crumpets toasted by the fireside
You don't need an invitation, step inside
Step inside my doorway
There's no admission fee at all
If you're in the neighborhood, you only have to call
I'll be glad to see you, it just cannot be denied
It's been a long time since I held you, step inside
Don't tell your mother about me
She'll only get angry knowing you've come back
What her heart can't see can't hurt her
So take my hand and step inside, take my hand and step inside
Don't tell your mother about me
You know she'll only get angry knowing you've come back
What her heart can't see can't hurt her
So take my hand and step inside, take my hand and step inside
If it gets too late, I have a bed that you can use
You don't need an invitation
If you feel the inclination
You just call on speculation
Step inside
Side, step inside
Step inside
Step inside
Step insideEmbed
