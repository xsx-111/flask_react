Maker LyricsDays of yellow saffron
Nights with purple skies
Melting in the sunbeams
From my maker's eyes
Mountain-colored lilac
In the distant haze
I would like to lie here
Timing all my days
Move past my window
Sunshine is shimmering
Jack-o-lanterns glimmering
Giant moths are flickering around
See, the moon is hiding
Underneath the sea
Pretty soon he'll venture
To take a look at me
So I humbly stand here
Beneath his golden glow
Doesn't he remind me
Of somebody I know?
I must be leaving
Back to reality
Don't you just pity me?
I could so easily stay hereEmbed
