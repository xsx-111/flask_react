Dear Eloise Lyrics
Dear Eloise, I am writing to say
A number of funny things I heard today
I heard that he's left you and run off to sea
Could be the best thing that's happened to me

Writing a letter to make you feel better
Sorry to hear that he left you that way
I could have told you, he was much older
So much older than you

You rushed in blindly, he treated you kindly
Until he found out what he could get from you
You should have departed before he got started
Now you've been burned just like I said you would

Please read my letter closely
It's beneficial too
You must read in-between the lines
A message you will see
If you use your mind, you'll find
I want you back with me
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

Writing a letter to make you feel better
Sorry to hear that he left you that way
I could have told you, he was much older
So much older than you
So much older than you
So much older than you

Dear Eloise, I am writing to say
A number of funny things I heard today
I heard that he's left you and run off to sea
Could be the best thing that's happened to meEmbed
