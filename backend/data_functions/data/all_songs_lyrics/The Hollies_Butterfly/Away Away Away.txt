Away Away Away LyricsI couldn't leave you if I tried
There would be no place I could hide
Away away away from you
When we are walking hand-in-hand
Throwing a shell across the sand
It's grand, so grand, to hold your hand
Nobody there except the two of us
Diggin' what we see
Wouldn't it be so nice to drag your feet
In the edge of the sea?
So we are staying where we are
All of our problems seem so far
Away away away away
So we are staying where we are
All of our problems seem so far
Away away away away
Nobody there except the two of us
Diggin' what we see
Wouldn't it be so nice to drag your feet
In the edge of the sea?
So we are staying where we are
All of our problems seem so far
Away away away away
Nobody there except the two of us
Diggin' what we see
Wouldn't it be so nice to drag your feet
In the edge of the sea?
Away away away ...Embed
