Try It LyricsTravel by the silver line
To a place that has no time
Why don't you try it now?
Working hard to see the light
Let your mind take up in flight
Why don't you try it now?
It's beautiful, seeing all the colors of the rainbow
Beautiful, covering the people that we know
See the color of health
Flowing from your older self
Why don't you try it now?
Living good, stopped playing games
Traveling the astral planes
Why don't you try it now?
It's beautiful, seeing all the colors of the rainbow
Beautiful, covering the people that we know
Travel by the silver line
To a place that has no time
Why don't you try it now?
Working hard to see the light
Let your mind take up in flight
Why don't you try it now?
See the color of health
Flowing from your older self
Why don't you try it now?
Living good, stopped playing games
Traveling the astral planes
Why don't you try it now?Embed
