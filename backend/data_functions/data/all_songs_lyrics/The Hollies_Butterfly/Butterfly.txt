Butterfly LyricsWe met on the shore of a lemonade lake
Weeping willows looked down where we lay
Orange blossoms I smell in your hair
Butterfly, flutter by, butterfly by
Waterfalls send your ripples to us
Here on the shore of the lemonade lake
Pond lilies play hide and seek with the fish
Rabbit run, run rabbit, rabbit run by
Roaring mountain is standing close by
Covered with snowdrops and glistening with dew
I hear the sound of a small hummingbird
I took your hand and I waltzed off with you
Come to the top of the mountain with me
Jump on a cloud and we'll float to and fro
Seeing the countryside covered with grass
And the top of the mountain with candy-floss and snow
Butterfly lazily drinking the sun
Lavishly sprinkled and painted with gold
Here in the land of the mist and the lake
Me and my true love will never grow oldEmbed
