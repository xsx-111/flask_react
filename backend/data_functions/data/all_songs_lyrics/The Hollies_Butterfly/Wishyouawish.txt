Wishyouawish LyricsSinging, singing in the sunshine
The countryside's mine
If I keep on singing, you'll follow behind
Tripping, tripping down the highway
No cares in my mind
As long as I'm going, they'll follow behind
I got no cares in my mind
Got no place to go
But still I don't mind
'Cos it's nice
Picking, picking up the daisies
I'm making a chain
If anybody breaks it, we'll start it again
I got no cares in my mind
Got no place to go
But still I don't mind
'Cos it's nice
Gazing, gazing down into the water
I'm diggin' the fish
I'll throw in a penny to wish you a wish
Singing, singing in the sunshine
The countryside's mine
If I keep on singing, you'll follow behind
(wish you a wish ...)Embed
