Leave Me LyricsLeave me
If it gives you satisfaction
Slander my name all over the place
Don't you have an inclination
You're gonna ruin a reputation
Leave me
Tell me
Now I've got you in the corner
Won't you admit you've been telling me lies
I don't care about you
I'll get along without just
Leave me
It's so hard to please (hard to please) you yeah
Tease (hard to tease) you
Leave me
I don't ever want you near me
Pack all your things and get out of my sight
Your love was made of sand
I've had all I can stand
Leave me
It's so hard to please (hard to please) you yeah
Tease (hard to tease) you
Leave me
I don't ever want you near me
Pack all your things and get out of my sight
Your love was made of sand
I've had all I can stand
Leave me
You've got to leave me baby
C'mon now
You've got to leave me babyEmbed
