Pegasus LyricsFollow me, follow, see what you see
I'll take somewhere where you've never been
High on a mountain, deep down in the sea
To faraway lands, you can travel with me
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
Ride on my back and hold onto my wings
I'll take you by night to a time-leaping dream
Time has no value where we're going to
People are happy; there, they're never blue
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
This can only happen to you
If you keep our secret
Don't tell anyone about our magic horse
You can go where you want, I can take you anywhere
Because I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
Follow me, follow, see what you see
I'll take somewhere where you've never been
High on a mountain, deep down in the sea
To faraway lands, you can travel with me
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
I'm Pegasus, the flying horse
I'm Pegasus, the flying horseEmbed
