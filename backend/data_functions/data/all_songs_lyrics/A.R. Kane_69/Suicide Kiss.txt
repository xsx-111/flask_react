Suicide Kiss LyricsWhat's happening, she's not there
Just silence, the writing's on the wall
This is not another sad story
This is just another heart in tears
This is not another sad story
This is just another heart in tears
What's been going on, the (?) before the fall
What came clear, and then i lost it all
This is not another sad love song
This is just another sad love crossed
This is not another sad love song
This is just another sad love crossed
I never like to turn it off
I never lied, so turn it off
Just turn it off
What's happening, there goes one more day
Obscene, erased for one more day
This is not another poor excuse
This is just another poor lost child
This is not another poor excuse
This is just another poor lost child
I never lied, just turn it off
No place to be, just turn it off
This is not another poor excuse
This is just another poor lost child
This is just a body without use
This is just another soul gone wildEmbed
