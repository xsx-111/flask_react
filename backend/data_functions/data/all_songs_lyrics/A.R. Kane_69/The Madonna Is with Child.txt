The Madonna Is with Child LyricsIn the big rain
In the big rain
Before we sleep, child
Before we sleep, child
Let your arms down, cover my head
Before the big rain comes
We go to sleep forever
There, there he comes, the beginning, child
Mother, cover my chest with your pretty breast
You said we're gonna live together
Sleep forever
Before the big rain comes
This is not the endEmbed
