Spermwhale Trip Over LyricsHere in my LSdream
Things are always what they seem
Here in my LSdream, in my LSdreaming
And all the shifting shapes
All changing to grapes
Never making mistakes
In my LSdream
And all the peoples, and all the fingers
And all the peoples, and all the fingers
In my LSdream
And circles buzzing with life
Tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe
Across my head
In my LSdreaming, oh yeah
LSdream, in my LSdream, LS, LS...
