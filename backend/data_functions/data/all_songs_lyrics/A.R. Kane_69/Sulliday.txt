Sulliday LyricsJust as an opening door makes the specks of dust fly
Oh do you know them?
Do you know they can bring you down?
In disguise...
In disguise...
Doesn't, look at those flowers
Oh oh
Do what you know
Every time i love you
I see angels crossing over
I see angels passing by
(?)
Tell when we make love like rain
And i couldn't save you (fishing)
Can't say
(?)
I told my heart today
That i love you
I tell my heart today
That i love you
(?)
Listening angels passing by
Pass me byEmbed
