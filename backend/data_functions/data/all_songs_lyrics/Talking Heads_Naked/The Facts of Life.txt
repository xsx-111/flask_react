The Facts of Life Lyrics
Monkey see and monkey do
Making babies, eating food
Smelly things, pubic hair
Words of love in the air
Sparks fly, shooting out
Making sure that everything is working
I can't turn you down
We are programmed happy little children
Matter over mind
We can not resist so I won't fight it
Love is a machine
Love is a machine without a driver

The facts of life

A masterpiece, biology
Smoky water, air conditioned
Boys 'n' girls and automation
Chromosomes, designer jeans
And chimpanzees and human beings
Machines of love

Strong in body, strong in mind
A love machine with the facts of life
The facts of life, the facts of life
So much sex 'n' violence must be a bad design
We're stupid to be fighting, every night
The monsters we create they welcome us aboard
The best in advertising from coast to coast
The girls and boys combine like monkeys in the zoo
The clouds have silver linings looks pretty good
People fall in love like in fairy tales
I'm not sure I like, what they can do
I'm afraid that God has no master plan
He only takes what he can use
Factory life, ice cream and pie
Factory life
Someday we'll live on Venus, men will walk on Mars
But we will still be monkeys down deep inside
If chimpanzees are smart then we will close our eyes
And let our instincts guide us, oh oh oh oh noEmbed
