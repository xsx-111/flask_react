Mommy Daddy You and I Lyrics
All the way from Baltimore we couldn't find a seat
Conductor says he's sorry for the blisters on our feet

Comes a-riding in a bus, the high and the low
Mommy, daddy, you and I
Going on a trip and we're not going home
Mommy, daddy, you and I, I

Driving, keep driving, driving, driving all night
Sleeping on my daddy's shoulder, drinking from a paper cup
And I'm wearing my grandfather's clothes and they say that up North it gets cold

Crawling out of bed one night, walking in my sleep
We're not the only family to take this little trip

Driving all the way up, It's 30 below
Mommy, daddy, you and I
Even little kids getting ready to go
Mommy, daddy, you and I, I

Chilly, Chilly-Willy, It's colder the further we go
Some are born to take advantage but saying it don't make it so
So hold me and don't let me go, 'cause the sidewalks are covered with snow
He's speaking English now and he's smoothing out his clothes
He's Mr. Button Down, he's leaving home

Making changes day by day and we still ain't got no plan
How we gonna make our way in this foreign land?

Well we'll keep driving, keep driving, driving with all of our might
Changing, still changing, changing the water of life
Keep that little man a shining, see how the tail can wag the dog

And we're all riding in this old bus
And the driver is singing to us
And we're wearing our grandfather's clothes
'cause we heard that up North it gets coldEmbed
