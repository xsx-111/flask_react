Book Song LyricsIf she knew what I see while I'm watching
Would she know where to smile, what to say
When she leaves from her book to be with me
Where's her mind as she stands while I play
She left behind names in the pages
And the time she took out they stayed here
Now she thinks that she maybe should tell them
Of my book and the places she's been
Now she's looking at me while I'm writing
Does she know where to smile, what to say
When she leaves from her book to be with me
What's she thinking about while I playEmbed
