Some Sweet Day LyricsSome sweet day, some sweet day
I'm gonna hold you like I want to
I'm gonna kiss you like I want to
I'm gonna love you like I need to
Some sweet day
Some sweet day, you will say
That you have started dreaming of me
That you love no-one else above me
I'll find a way to make you love me
Some sweet day
I hope it won't be long
Till I can take you and make you my very own
'Cause can't you see I get so tired
Of wishing and dreaming alone
Some sweet day, some sweet day
You'll get that twinkle in your eye, love
You're gonna look at me and sigh, love
And then you tell me that you're my love
Some sweet day
Some sweet day, some sweet day
You'll get that twinkle in your eye, love
You're gonna look at me and sigh, love
And then you tell me that you're my love
Some sweet dayEmbed
