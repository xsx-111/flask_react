Meet on the Ledge LyricsWe used to say "There'd come the day we'd all be making songs
Or finding better words" These ideas never lasted long
The way is up along the road, the air is growing thin
Too many friends who tried, blown off this mountain with the wind
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
When my time is up, I'm going to see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes around again
Yet now I see, I'm all alone, but that's the only way to be
You'll have your chance again, then you can do the work for me
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
When my time is up, I'm going to see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes around again
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
When my time is up, I'm going to see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes around againEmbed
