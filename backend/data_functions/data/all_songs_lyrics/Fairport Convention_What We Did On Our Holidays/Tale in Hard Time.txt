Tale in Hard Time LyricsThompson
Take the sun from my heart
Let me learn to despise
I'll show you another who cannot tell lies
The blind man can't see
Who demands to his eyes
I'll show you another who sings as he cries
I cannot be whole
As the beggar who sighs
I'll show you another who knows as he diesEmbed
