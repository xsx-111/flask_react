Nottamun Town LyricsIn Nottamun Town, not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look down
Not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look down
To show me the way to fair Nottamun Town
When the king and the queen and a company more
Were a-walking behind
And riding before
Come a stark naked drummer
A-beating the drum
With his hands on his bosom come marching along
Sat down on a hard, hard cold frozen stone
Ten thousand stood around me
Yet I was alone
Took my hat in my hands
For to keep my head warm
Ten thousand got drownded that never was born
In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look down
Not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look down
To show me the way to fair Nottamun Town
