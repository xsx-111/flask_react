Mr Lacey LyricsPlease, Mr Lacey, let me work your loving machine
Please, Mr Lacey, let me work your loving machine
Will you let me control the handles, you know it's the best thing I've ever seen
Well, Mr Lacey, where'd you learn just what to do?
Well, Mr Lacey, where'd you learn just what to do?
Can you fix me up now with a teacher, I wanna become an inventor too
Why, Mr Lacey, why d'you do the things you do?
Why, Mr Lacey, why d'you do the things you do?
It's true no one here understands now but maybe someday they'll catch up with youEmbed
