She Moves Through the Fair LyricsMy young love said to me
My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind
Then she stepped away from me
And this she did say
"It will not be long love
Till our wedding day"
She stepped away from me
And she moved through the fair
And fondly I watched her
Moved here and move there
Then she made her way homeward
With one star awake
As the swan in the evening
Moves over the lake
I dreamt it last night
That my dead love came in
So softly she moved
That her feet made no din
Then she came close beside me
And this she did say
"It will not be long love
Till our wedding day"Embed
