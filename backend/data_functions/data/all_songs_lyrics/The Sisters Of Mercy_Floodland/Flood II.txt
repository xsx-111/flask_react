Flood II LyricsAnd her hallway moves
Like the ocean moves
And her hallway moves
Like the sea
Like the sea
She says no no no no harm will come your way
She says bring it on down, bring on the wave
She says: nobody done no harm
Grace of God and raise your arms
She says: face it and it's a place to stay
This, this is the way it was
This, this is the way it is
When the water come rushing, rushing in
She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood
And her hallway
Like...
Like...
Like a million voices call my name
Like a million voices calling
Not now, not never again...
Sitting here now in this bar for hours
Strange men rent strange flowers
Seconds to the drop but it feels like hours and I
Think I'm going to... going to sleep
This, this is the way it was
This, this is the way it is
When the water come rushing, rushing in
She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood
And her hallway...
She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood
And her hallway...Embed
