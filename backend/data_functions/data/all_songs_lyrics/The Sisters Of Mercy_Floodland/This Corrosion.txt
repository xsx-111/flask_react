This Corrosion LyricsHey, hey, hey, ye-hey, now, no-now, now
Hey, hey, hey, ye-hey, now, no-now, now
Hey, hey, hey, ye-hey, now, no-now, now
Gimme the ring, kissed and told
Gimme something that I missed (Gimme the ring)
A hand to hold, wild and what it seems (Gimme the ring)
Kill the king with love is the law
And then "wheel" turn round... (Gimme the ring)
Gimme dream child and do you hear me call? (Gimme the ring)
On the loan and on the level
And still on the floor (Gimme the ring)
Sing dream child and do you hear at all?
(Sing)
(Sing)

Gimme siren, child, and do you hear me?
Gimme siren, child, and do you hear me call?
Sing, child, of right and wrong
Gimme things that don't last long
Gimme siren, child, and do you hear me call?

Hey now, hey now, now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now, now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now, now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now, now
On days like this
In times like these
I feel an animal deep inside
Heel to haunch on bended knees
Living on if and if I tried
Somebody send me... please...
Dream wars and a ticket to seem
Giving out and in
Selling the don't belong
Well, what do you say
D'you have a word for Giving Away?
Got a song for me?
(Sing)

Hey now, hey now, now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now, now...
I got nothing to say I ain't said before
I bled all I can, I won't bleed no more
I don't need no one to understand
Why the blood runs cold in the hired hand
On heart, hand of God
Floodland and Driven Apart
Run cold (Hey now, hey now now)
Turn, cold, burn (like a healing hand)
Hey now, hey now, now, sing This Corrosion to me
