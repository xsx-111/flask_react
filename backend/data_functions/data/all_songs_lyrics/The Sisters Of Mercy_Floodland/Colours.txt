Colours LyricsYou reap what you sow
Put your face to the ground
Here come the marching men
Your colours wrapped around
You reap what you sow
Put your face to the ground
Here come the marching men
Your colours wrapped around
You reap what you sow
You reap what you sow
Put your face to the ground
Here come the marching men
Your colours wrapped around
You reap what you sow
Put your face to the ground
Here come the marching men
Your colours wrapped aroundEmbed
