30-Year War Lyrics
It's the longest running joke in history
To kill the working classes in the name of liberty
The lies of Hillsborough
The blood of Orgreave
All the evasion at the BBC
And 30 years of war
To darken all our class
Black propaganda, lies and mistrust
See it in our eyes, the fire dimming away
The old-boy network won the war again 

So you hide all Lowry's paintings
For 30 years or more
'Cos he turned down a knighthood
And you must now settle the score
And the endless parade of old Etonian scum
Line the front benches so what is to be done?
All part of the same establishment
I ask you again what is to be done? 

These verses at attention stand
Ready for the immortal command
The armies of my pages may never fight again
Happy for the order to meet eternal flame
Blame the poor
Praise the rich
Make the connections
Put them in print
Keep 'em boxed in
Keep 'em kettled in
Create a mistruth
So bewildering
