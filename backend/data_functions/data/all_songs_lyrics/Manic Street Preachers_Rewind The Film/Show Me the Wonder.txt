Show Me the Wonder LyricsThis is no threat
Just an invitation
A sense of belonging
A sense of inspiration
Is Heaven a place
Where nothing ever happens?
Is it too much to ask
To disbelieve in everything?

Show me the wonder!
I have seen the birthplace of the universe
Show me the wonder!
I have seen miracles move in reverse
If you're exiled
By all the cruel tongues
Then show me the wonder
The wonder of your love
The tapping pain of madness
Running through the veins
We may write in English
But our truth remains in Wales

Pray for the silence
When we look into the mirror
Staying so patient
We measure the nostalgia
Is Heaven a place
Where nothing ever happens?
Is it too much to ask
To disbelieve in everything?

Show me the wonder!
I have seen miracles move in reverseEmbed
