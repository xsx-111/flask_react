3 Ways to See Despair Lyrics
There are three ways to see despair;
I've seen them all, I'm scared to say
The three ways are real, I've lived through them all
The fourth way is coming so prepare for the fall

Can you save someone from the hidden depths
Of a darkened soul with no hope left?
And I don't know how and I don't know when
But I pray that you'll be beautiful again
And I don't know how and I don't know when
But I pray that you'll be beautiful again

I am as tired as John Lennon sang
Conveying exhaustion like no one else can
I am no longer the centre of the universe
A bare admission that makes it seem worse
A bare admission that makes it seem worse
A bare admission that makes it seem worseEmbed
