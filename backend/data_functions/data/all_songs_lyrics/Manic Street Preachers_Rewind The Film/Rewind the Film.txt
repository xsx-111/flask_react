Rewind the Film Lyrics
Rewind the film again
I'd love to see my joy, my friends
Rewind the film again
So I can fall asleep content

Rewind the film once more
Turn back the pages of my books
Rewind the film once more
I want the world to see it all

I want to feel small
Lying in my mother's arms
Playing my old records
Hoping that they never stop

There's too much heartbreak
In the nothing of the now
I want to see it all
Never want to let it go


Let me hide under the sheets
And celebrate the boredom
Let me hide under the sheets
With the radio on



I want to feel small
Holding on my father's hands
Playing broken records
Praying that they never stop

There is too much heartbreak
In the nothing of the now
I want to see it all
Never want to let you down

I want the world to see all the love
And security, my childhood dreams
But now I am a busted flesh
And I am waiting for the night to come

So rewind the film again
I'd love to see my joy, my friends
Yes, rewind the film again
So I can fall asleep content1Embed
