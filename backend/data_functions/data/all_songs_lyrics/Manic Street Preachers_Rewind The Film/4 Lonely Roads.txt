4 Lonely Roads Lyrics
4 lonely roads
The terror it had flown
Never led you home
4 lonely roads
Got sunk into my heart
Then it fell apart

Staring with an idle eye
Measuring the pain inside
Darker hell stood up on high
Then disappeared without reply
I don't know why

4 lonely roads
I'm trapped inside the skin
Can't let love back in
4 lonely roads
The cities drunk and mute
Lost in your pursuit
Then tell them this

And if we can
Then we must
Hold our heads up
Learn to trust
It's up to you
It's up to us
Some dignity
A little love Embed
