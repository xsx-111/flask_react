As Holy as the Soil (That Buries Your Skin) Lyrics
As holy as the soil that buries your skin
As holy as the love we'll never give
As holy as the time that drifted away
I love you so will you please come home
As holy as the Roman Empire
As holy as the coffee you made for us
As holy as those nights we walked in the rain
I love you so, will you please come home

So come on, would it be that hard?
Just for once we could save the world
Just me and you doing something true
Even if it only lasts for seconds

As lonely as the darkness between the stars
As fragile as the people we are
As sacred as those words we shared and displayed
I love you so, will you please come home
As beautiful as the spring in Japan
As generous as your safe strong hands
As wasted as the lifetimes we spent far apart
I love you so will you please come home
So come on, would it be that hard?
Just for once we could save the world
Just me and you doing something true
Even if it only lasts for seconds

Oh I love you so won't you please come home
Oh, it's been so long, I can't let go
Oh I love you so won't you please come home
I love you so won't you please come homeEmbed
