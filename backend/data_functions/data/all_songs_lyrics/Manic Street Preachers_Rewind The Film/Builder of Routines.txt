Builder of Routines Lyrics
I've sealed myself in
Laminated all of my skin
Sellotaped my world in bits
I must embrace paralysis

Only in you do we see ourselves
Only in you can imagine an end
So sick and so tired of being for real
Only the fiction still has the appeal

Builder of Routines
It makes me safe and clean
It crucifies parts of me
But never seems to make me bleed


How I hate middle age
In between acceptance and rage
Democracy has sure made a fool out of me
But I am the builder of routinesEmbed
