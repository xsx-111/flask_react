Death of a Digital Ghost Lyrics
You were crying
You were crying

I should have told you to stay longer
I want to hold you, keep you closer
Never felt it was an option
It's been so long, it's getting harder
It's not enough to see the future
When the past won't disappear
I dread the moment and it's coming
There's no way of escaping

And I guess there's not a happy ending
All the weakness that I am protecting
Now it's time to stop all this pretending
Couldn't tell you 'cause

You were crying
You were crying
You were crying
You were crying
There's no time to be tender
Never stopped always wanting
Face to face with a departure
Disguise the pain by acting stronger
Your smile burnt into the silence
Your words comfort and are timeless
There's no point in finding answers
The sun is rising through the vapour

And I guess there's not a happy ending
All the weakness that I am protecting
Now it's time to stop all this pretending
I couldn't tell you 'cause

You were crying
You were crying
You were crying
You were crying
You were crying
You were crying
You were crying
You were cryingEmbed
