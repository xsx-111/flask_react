(I Miss the) Tokyo Skyline Lyrics
Lost on my own in the blazing sun
Down through the streets of Tokyo
Feeling like an alien is so much fun
This place somehow feels like a second home

I dream of the Tokyo skyline
I miss the emptiness and the silence
I long for the non-communication
Everything is happily lost in translation

I miss the Tokyo skyline
I miss the smog and the sunshine
Every night I sit and remember
This love I feel for a modern wonder
