Rave Down LyricsRave down
Rave down
Rave down
Rave down, hit the ground
Before the pistol crack spins me out sideways
Like the sharp hard hit of a car crash in a dream
There's kids on the corner wanna
Beat-box my brains to bits
You can't cut creed clean
Things ain't black or white like they seem
Rave down, hit the ground
4 AM all night hell gas station
Before we cruise off to the beach
Where the breeze blows easy and slow
We hung tight all night and no gig to go to
There could be something happenin' here
But there's just no place to go
Your town ain't lively up no more
Rave Down
Deep hot sun burns through the city
Yeah, they're havin' to peel
The pedestrians off the walls
Ex-cop 'round the block
Rockin' chair, suckin' beer
He blasts flies with his gun
Because swatting's no fun
Your town ain't hypin' up no more
Rave down
Rave down, hit the groundEmbed
