Over LyricsDon't say it's over
Don't say it's true
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're through
I can't believe it's over
I can't believe it's true
I can't believe it's over
I can't believe we're through
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's true
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're through
The ocean drops
She cups her hands over me
We drift out to sea
And now I can see
The saving danger waves
But I wanna see it all
I want to see
I wanna breathe it all
I want to breathe
I want to breathe
Wanna breathe
I wanna
It's all I can do
To swim closer to you
The big wide world
Is beating me around the earsEmbed
