Sandblasted LyricsHow does it feel to feel
You know it's for real?
Don't say we'll die
You know it's a lie
I watch from reel to real
Don't see what I feel
Split open wide
Awash in the tide
The beach seemed surreal
Depends how you feel
The sea stretched for miles
I drove all the while
You ask what I feel
I still feel so real
Taken for a ride
And bleeding inside
How does it feel to feel
You know it's for real?
Split open wide
How does it feel to feel
You know it's for real?
The sea stretched for miles
I drove all the while
Don't see what I feel
Don't see what I feel
Don't see what I feelEmbed
