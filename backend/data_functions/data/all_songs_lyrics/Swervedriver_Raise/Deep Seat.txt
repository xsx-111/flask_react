Deep Seat LyricsYou close my eyes without blinking
You read my thoughts without thinking
You sit and smile and I'm sinking
Could be the cause of my drinking
You fabricate what I'm feeling
You rise up riled and I'm reeling
I swallow salt and you're peeling
We lie and stare at the ceiling
You close my eyes and I'm drinking
You read my thoughts and I'm blinking
You sit and smile and I'm thinking
Could be the cause of my sinking1Embed
