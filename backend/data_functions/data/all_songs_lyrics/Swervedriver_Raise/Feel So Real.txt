Feel So Real LyricsWhen it seems so real
I can just close my eyes and it's real
When it's dream's so real
I can just let it beam on it's theme
When it feels so good
I can hardly believe that it's true
Seems so real
Seems so real
Seems so real
When it seems serene
I can hardly believe that it's true
When the dreams so new
I can just toss it over to you
When it seems so good
I can hardly believe that she's true
Seems so real
Seems so real
Seems so real
When it feels so good
I can hardly believe that it's true
Seems so real
Seems so real
Seems so real
When it seems so real
I can just close my eyes and it's real
When it's real serene
I can just let it beam on it's theme
When it feels so good
I can hardly believe that it's realEmbed
