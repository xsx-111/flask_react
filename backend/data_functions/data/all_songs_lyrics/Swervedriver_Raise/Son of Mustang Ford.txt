Son of Mustang Ford LyricsYeah Mustang take me
Mustang Ford take me far away
Been driving for days now
Been driving to take the pain away
Gotta get some love now
Love back in my veins, gotta kill this pain
Drove down to the shoreline
Hey shoreline take me far away
There was a sign by the roadside
Back by the road is where my body's layin'
Hallucinogen headlamps
My sane scape's disrupted in a pickup truck
Drive
Hallucinogen headlamps
My sane scape's disrupted in a pickup truck
(The radio still plays
Among the mangled metal frays
Petroleum spirit daze)
Been drivin' for days now
Oh Yeah
There was a sign by the roadside
Oh Yeah
Gotta get some love now
Love back in my veins, gotta quit this pain
Do you satisfy my soul (yeah, such a shame)
I got clean out of control (soul ride train train)
Held ransom, Rock 'n RollEmbed
