Kill the Superheroes LyricsPlease take it away
I don't need your ideals today
I'm holdin' out for a new kind of hero
Punk barrio town
Your heart broken pogo up & down
D.C - O.D. I wanna cyber-punk hero
Grab a case and see
Messed Chicanos, Ape Sex, Ray D
As the ashes snow I know I loved a real hero
Hey Doyle drive us downtown
Fuck the pigs and ruck it up & down
Score Vato's Gold I've been told
It's a rad beer aaah
Bombs drop on your town
You gotta learn to love 'em, frown & drown
Caribbean seas draw so much nearer
Death squads abound
They're just out to raze you to the ground
As the ashes snow I know loved a real hero
Please take it away I don't need your ideals today
I'm holdin' out for a new kind of hero
Punk Rock barrio town
Your heart broken, pogo up & down
D.C. - O.D. I want a cyber-punk hero
Grab a case and see
Messed Chicanos, Ape Sex, Ray D
As the ashes snow I know I loved a real heroEmbed
