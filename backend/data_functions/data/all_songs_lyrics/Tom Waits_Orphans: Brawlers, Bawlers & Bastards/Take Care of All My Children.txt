Take Care of All My Children LyricsOh take care of all my children
Don't let them wander and roam
Take care of all of my children
For I don't know when I'm comin' back home
You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
Nail a sign on the door
Bright and early Sunday morning
With my walking cane
I'm going up to see my lord
Oh keep them together at the sundown
Safe from the devil's hand
You gotta make them a pillow
On the hard ground
I'll be going up to Beaulah land
You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
Nail a sign on the door
Bright and early Sunday morning
With my walking cane
I'm going up to see my lord
Remember you never trust the devil
Stay clear of Lucifer's hand
Don't let them wander in the meadow
Or you'll wind up in the frying pan
You can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
Nail a sign on the door
Bright and early Sunday morning
With my walking cane
I'm going up to see my lordEmbed
