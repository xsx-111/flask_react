Walk Away LyricsDot King was whittled from the bone of Cain
With a little drop of poison in the red, red blood
She need a way to turn around the bend
She said, I want to walk away and start over again
There are things I've done I can't erase
I want to look in the mirror, see another face
I said never would I do it again
I want to walk away, start over again
No more rain, no more roses
On my way, shake my thirst in a cool, cool pond
There's a winner in every place
There's a heart that's beating in every page
The beginning of it starts at the end
When it's time to walk away and start over again
Weather's murder at a hundred-and-three
William Ray shot Corabell Lee
A yellow dog knows when he has sinned
You want to walk away and start over again
No more rain, no more roses
On my way, shaking my thirst in a cool cool pond
Cooper told Molly the whole block's gone
They're dying for jewelry, money, and clothes
I always get out of the trouble I'm in
I want to walk away, start over again
I left my bible by the side of the road
Carved my initials in an old dead tree
I'm going away, but I'm going to be back when
It's time to walk away and start over again1Embed
