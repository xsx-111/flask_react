Sea of Love LyricsCome with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I wanna tell you how much I love you
But I'm drowning in a sea of love
Do you remember the night we met?
That's the night I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you how much I love you
But I'm drowning in a sea of love
Come with me to the sea, oh yeah
Do you remember the night we met?
Well, that's the night I just knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you how much I love you
But I'm down here in the sea of love
Come with me to the sea, oh yeah
Oh and do you remember the night we met?
That's the night I just knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you how much I love you
Goin' down in the sea of love
Come with me to the sea, oh yeah
Do you remember the night we met?
That's the night I just knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you how much I love you
But I'm down here in the sea of love
Oh come with me to the sea, oh yeah
Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I wanna tell you how much I love you
But I'm down here in the sea of love
Oh come with me to the sea, oh yeah2Embed
