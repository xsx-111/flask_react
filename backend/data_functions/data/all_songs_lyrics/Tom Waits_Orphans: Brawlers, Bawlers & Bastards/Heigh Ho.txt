Heigh Ho Lyrics
Well, we dig, dig, dig
Well, we dig in our mine
The whole day through
Dig, dig, dig
That is what we like to do

Yeah, it ain't no trick
To get rich quick
If you dig, dig, dig
With a shovel and a pick
Dig, dig, dig
The whole day through
Got to dig, dig, dig
It's what we like to do

In our mine, in our mine
Where a million diamonds shine
We got to dig, dig, dig
From the morning 'til the night
Dig, dig, dig up
Everything in sight
We got to dig, dig, dig
In our mine, in our mine
Dig up diamonds by the score
A thousand rubies, sometimes more
But we don't know
What we are digging for, yeah

Heigh ho, heigh ho
It's off to work we go
We keep on singing
All day long, heigh ho

Heigh ho, heigh ho
Got to make your troubles go
Well, you keep on singing
All day long, heigh ho

Heigh ho
