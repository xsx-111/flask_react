The Fall of Troy LyricsIt's the same with men as with horses and dogs
Nothing wants to die
Evelyn James they killed in a game
With guns too big for their hands
Just off St. Charles in no man's land
And you'll have to find your own way home boys
You'll have to find your own way home
The oldest was Troy
An eighteen year old boy
Shot dead in March in a robbery
His brother started out to hell and to ruin
Troy's killer was never caught they say
Young Nick he just went bad that day
Now he'll have to find his own way home
Boys, he'll have to find his own way home
Why cook dinner
Why make my bed
Why come home at all
Out the door and through the woods
There's a world where nothing grows
It's hard to say grace and to sit in the place
Of someone missing at the table
Mom's hair sprayed tight and her face in her hands
Watching TV for answers to me
After all she's only human
She's trying to find her own way home boys
She's trying to find her own way home
My legs ache
My heart is sore
The well is full of pennies1Embed
