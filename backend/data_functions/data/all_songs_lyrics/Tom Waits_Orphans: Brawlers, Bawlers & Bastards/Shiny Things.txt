Shiny Things LyricsThe things a crow puts in its nest
They are always things he finds that shine best
Somehow he'll find a shiny dime
A silver twine from a valentine
The crows all bring them shiny things
Leave me alone, you big old moon
The light you cast is just a liar
You're like the crows 'cause if it glows
You're dressed to go, you guessed, I know
You'll always bring them shiny things
Well I'm not dancing here tonight
But things are bound to turn around though
The only thing I want that shines
Is to be king there in your eyes
To be your only shiny thingEmbed
