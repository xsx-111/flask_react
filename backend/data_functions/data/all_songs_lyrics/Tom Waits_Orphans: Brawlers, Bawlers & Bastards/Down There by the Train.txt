Down There by the Train LyricsThere's a place I know
Where the train goes slow
Where the sinners can be washed
In the blood of the lamb
There's a river by the trestle
Down by Sinner's Grove
Down where the Willow and the Dogwood grows
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train
Goes slow
You can hear the whistle
You can hear the bell
From the halls of heaven
To the gates of hell
There's room for the foresaken
If you're there on time
You'll be washed of all your sins
And all of your crimes
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train
Goes slow
There's a golden moon
That shines up through the mist
I know that your name
Will be on that list
There's no eye for an eye
There's no tooth for a tooth
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train
Goes slow
So if you live in darkness
If you live in shame
All of the passengers
Will be treated the same
Old Humpty Jackson and Gyp the Blood will sing
Charlie Whitman is on the Dillinger's wings
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train
Goes slow
If you've lost all your hope
If you've lost all your faith
I know you will be cared for
I know you will be safe
All the shameful and all of the whores
Even the soldier who pierced the heart of the lord
Is down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train
Goes slow
Well I've never asked forgiveness and
I've never said a prayer
I've never given of myself
I've never truly cared
I've hurt the ones who loved me
I'm still raising Cain
I've taken the low road and
If you've done the same
Meet me down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train
Goes slowEmbed
