Danny Says LyricsDanny says we gotta go
Gotta go to Idaho
But we can't go surfing
Cause it's 20 below
Sound check is at 5:02
Record stores and interviews
I can't wait to be with you tomorrow
Baby oh ho oh ho
We got nowhere to go
And it may sound funny
But it's true
Hanging out in 100 b
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinking about you and me and you and me
Hanging out in L.A. and there's nowhere to go
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
Listening to Sheena on the radio
Oh ho oh ho
Sound check is at 5:02
Record stores and interviews
And I can't wait to be with you tomorrowEmbed
