All the Time LyricsYou're the tree that you can't eat the fruit from
I heard horses come to ride me away
I want shade and a good place to shoot from
If I was a clock, I'd be the end of the day
You know you're not the boss of me
You can lift your skirt, you can shake your hair
But I got all the time in the world
You're the ditch in the road where the wheels keep spinning
You're the same dead cat clawing its way back, grinning
You know you got a bad reputation, your nine lives way down the line
I got a jacket to put on and a hat to wear
I wouldn't waste a gallon on you out there
And I've got all the time in the world
A bridge is only there for you to jump off of
And there ain't no rain clouds that are blue
I do declare my independence
Baby, I shot off all my fireworks for you
The river's burning and the trees are on fire
There's lots of good rubber left on these tires
And I've got all the time in the world
Baby, you're the light that won't change that I got stuck at
You're the fan that won't work at the motel
They were all out of red, so I got me a blue one
Baby, you're always using mine
Why don't you get you one?
I know you won't go very far
You left your blonde wig in the car
And I got all the time in the world2Embed
