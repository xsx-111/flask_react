Fish in the Jailhouse LyricsPeoria Johnson told Dudlow Joe
"I can break out of any old jail you know
The bars are iron the walls are stone
All I need me is an old fish bone"
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
Serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
Alright, ah yea, they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
Oh boy, they're serving fish in the jailhouse
Fish in the jailhouse tonight
Corvina opal eye hammerhead shark
Steelhead salmon or a mud bank carp
I'll sand one side dull, I'll whittle the other side sharp
By Saturday night, I'll be in Central Park
Serving fish in the jailhouse tonight, alright
Did you hear they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight?
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight, oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse
Fish in the jailhouse tonight
Ask Little Son Jackson or the 44 Kid
Or Whitfield Faraday what I did
From Yazoo City down to Rolling Fork
From Natchez to Kinosha, New Dime to New York
Serving fish in the jailhouse tonight, alright
Lookee here, they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
Alright, oh boy, they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
We're serving fish in the jailhouse
Fish in the jailhouse tonight
Gimme a nice totuava or a chicken of the sea
I'm gonna fashion me a fishbone skeleton key
Tell Scullion Childs I won't be late
You can bet your freedom I'm gonna clean my plate
Serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
They're serving fish in the jailhouse
Fish in the jailhouse tonight
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
Serving fish in the jailhouse tonight, alrightEmbed
