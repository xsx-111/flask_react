Little Drop of Poison Lyrics
I like my town with a little drop of poison
Nobody knows they're lining up to go insane
I'm all alone, I smoked my friends down to the filter
But I feel much cleaner after it rains

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

Did the devil make the world while god was sleeping?
You'll never get a wish from a bone
Another long goodbye and a hundred sailors
That deep blue sky is my home

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

And the rat always knows when he's in with weasels
Here you lose a little every day
Well I remember when a million was a million
They all have ways to make you pay
And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison2Embed
