King Kong LyricsThey shot him down
They shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the king
They came to his island
And they brought her with them
They wanted to get his picture
But they were surprised
By his enormous size
And when he saw the woman
He took her without question
Because after all
He was the king
And he loved the woman
He loved the way she looked
And she wouldn't stop screaming
But he loved the woman
And he fought a Tyrannosaurus Rex
And it was a bloody battle
But he fought it for his woman
And he climbed up a mountain
And he looked around
Some kind of forest
With all these dinosaurs
And he stripped his woman
He stripped her bare
But there was a pterodactyl
There
And then a hero
Came and took his woman
And they fell off the mountain
Into some water
And then later
He came looking for his woman
But they were waiting
And they threw a bomb
And they tied him
And took him across the ocean
And they chained him
And put him in the show
And when he saw his woman
He broke loose
And everyone fled in terror
And he was looking for her
And he overtook a train
And he was looking in the street
And then he found her in her apartment
And he climbed up
The Empire State Building
It was like a phallic symbol
And he took his woman
To the top of that towering temple
And he climbed up and looked around
Some kind of city
With all those skyscrapers
And all the cars
Just him and his screaming woman
And they were finally alone
He loved his woman
You could see it in his eyes
His great big eyes
He loved his woman
From the moment that he saw her
He was all choked up inside
But when the airplanes came
He was soon to die
But he hung on long enough to set his woman down
And make sure that she was safe
And as the bullets pierced
He looked at her so sincere
Before he fell
Because he loved his woman
And they shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the king
Who killed the monkey
'twas beauty that killed the beast
And Willis O'Brien died
A tragic death
There wasn't much
That he had left
And Ray Harryhousen said
That when Willis died
That's when the king was really dead
They shot him down
They shot him down
They thought he was a monster
But he was the kingEmbed
