World Keeps Turning LyricsOn our anniversary
There'll be someone else where you used to be
The world don't care and yet it clings to me
The moon is gold and silvery
Who knows where the sidewalk ends?
Well, the road will turn and the road will bend
They always say he marks the sparrow's fall
How can anyone believe it all?
Well, the band has stopped playing, but we keep dancing
The world keeps turning, the world keeps turning
On his hand, he wore the ring of another
The world keeps turning, the world keeps turning
We broke the bank and we tore up the place
We disappeared oh without a trace
Now the sun, it falls into the sea
I know I'm the only one for me
I was so green and the dress you wore was yellow
The world keeps turning, the world keeps turning
The sun is down and the moon is in the meadow
The world keeps turning, the world keeps turning
Put a hat on your head
Will you paint the whole damn town red with me?
Well, the band has stopped playing, but we keep dancing
The world keeps turning, the world keeps turning
On his hand, he wore the ring of another
The world keeps turning, the world keeps turningEmbed
