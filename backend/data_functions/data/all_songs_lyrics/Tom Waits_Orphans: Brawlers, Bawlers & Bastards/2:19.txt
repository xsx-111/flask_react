2:19 LyricsI lost everything I had in the '29 flood
The barn was buried beneath a mile of mud
Now I've got nothing but the whistle and the steam
My baby leaving on the 2:19
Now there's a fellow that's preaching about hell and damnation
Bouncing off the walls in the Grand Central station
I treated her bad, I treated her mean
My baby leaving on the 2:19
I said hey hey, I don't know what to do
Hey hey, I will remember you
Hey hey, I don't know what to do
My baby leaving on the 2:19
Now I've always been puzzled by the yin and the yang
It'll come out in the wash, but it always leaves a stain
The sturm and the drang, the luster and the sheen
My baby leaving on the 2:19
Lost the baby with the water, the preacher stole the bride
Sent her out for a bottle, but when she came back inside
She didn't have my whiskey, she didn't have my gin
Had a hat full of feathers and a wicked grin
I said hey hey, I don't know what to do
Hey hey, I will remember you
Hey hey, I don't know what to do
My baby's leaving on the 2:19
On the train, you get smaller as you get farther away
The roar covers everything you wanted to say
Was that a raindrop in the corner of your eye?
Were you drying your nails or waving goodbye?
I said hey hey, I will remember you
Hey hey, I don't know what to do
Hey hey, I will remember you
My baby leaving on the 2:19
I said hey hey, I don't know what to do
Hey hey, I will remember you
Hey hey, I don't know what to do
My baby's leaving on the 2:19
I said hey hey, I don't know what to do
Hey hey, I will remember you
Hey hey, I don't know what to do
My baby leaving on the 2:19
I said heyEmbed
