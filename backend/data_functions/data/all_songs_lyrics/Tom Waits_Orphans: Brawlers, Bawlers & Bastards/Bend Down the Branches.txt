Bend Down the Branches LyricsThe sky is as deep as it can be
Bend down the branches
Close your eyes and you will see
Bend down the branches
You're like a willow
Once you were gold
We're made for bending
Even beauty gets old
Climb the stairs they're not so steep
Bend down the branches
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Bend down the branchesEmbed
