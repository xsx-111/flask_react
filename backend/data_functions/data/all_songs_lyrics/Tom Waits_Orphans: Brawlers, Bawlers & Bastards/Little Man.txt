Little Man LyricsAs sure as fire will burn
There's one thing you will learn
Is things you have cherished
Are things that you have earned
Luck is when opportunity
Meets with preparation
The same is true for every generation
Little man
As you climb on my knee
The whole future lies in thee
Little man
Little man
Never hurry
Take it slow
Things worthwhile
Need time to grow
Little man
Don't look back
There are things that might distract
Move ahead towards your goal
And the answers will unfold
Little man
Love is always in the air
It is there for those who care
Little man
Don't look back
There are things that might distract
Move ahead towards your goal
And the answers will unfold
Little man
Love is always in the air
It is there for those who care
