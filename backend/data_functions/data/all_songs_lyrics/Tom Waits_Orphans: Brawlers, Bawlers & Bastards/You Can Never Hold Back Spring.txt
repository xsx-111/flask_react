You Can Never Hold Back Spring LyricsYou can never hold back spring
You can be sure I will never stop believing
The blushing rose that will climb
Spring ahead or fall behind
Winter dreams the same dream every time
Baby, you can never hold back spring
Even though you've lost your way
The world is dreaming, dreaming of spring
So close your eyes, open your heart
To the one who's dreaming of you
You can never hold back spring
Remember everything that spring can bring
Baby, you can never hold back springEmbed
