Rains on Me LyricsThis is how the world will be
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
Forty monkeys drowning in a boiling sea
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
I went down into the valley to pray
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
I got drunk and I stayed all day
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
It rains on me
All God's children, can't you see?
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
Louie Lista and Marchese
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
Robert Sheehan and Paul Bodee
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
I went down to Argyle, I went down to Dix
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
To get my special powders and to get my fix
Everywhere I go, it rains on me
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
It rains on me
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I goEmbed
