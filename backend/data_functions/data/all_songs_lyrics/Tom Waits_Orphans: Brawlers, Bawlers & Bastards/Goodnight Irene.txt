Goodnight Irene LyricsIrene, good night, Irene
Irene, good night
Good night, Irene
Good night, Irene
I kiss you in my dreams
Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
I'm gonna take me a little stroll uptown
Irene, good night, Irene
Irene, good night
Good night, Irene
Good night, Irene
I kiss you in my dreams
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump in the river and drown
Oh-Irene, good night, Irene
Irene, good night
Good night, Irene
Good night, Irene
I kiss you in my dreams
I love Irene, God knows I do
I'll love her till the sea runs dry
If she ever loves another
I'm gonna take morphine and die
Oh-Irene, good night, Irene
Irene, good night
Good night, Irene
Good night, Irene
I kiss you in my dreams
Stop your rambling, stop your gambling
Stop staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and your family
Sit down by the fire light
Â¡EVERYBODY!
Irene, good night, Irene
Irene, good night
Good night, Irene
Good night, Irene
I kiss you in my dreamsEmbed
