Poor Little Lamb LyricsPoor little lamb
Now his fleece is all cold
Wakes up in the morning alone
Poor little lamb
Knows what's coming
Life is an empty cup
Poor little lamb
Watch your shoulder
Coyote's waiting out there
Nobody will get any older
If we don't find a way out of here
So let's go on a bummer this summer
Where we won't have to be afraid
The world will be on a hummer boys
And we'll laugh and we'll drink lemonadeEmbed
