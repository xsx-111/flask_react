Buzz Fledderjohn LyricsI stood on the roof of Stuart's old Dodge
To get a better look at the Fledderjohn's lodge
Bait shop pistols and ammo too
Nothing but books about World War II
Rottweiler doberman, a Pinkerton guard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I seen a python swallowing a doberman whole
Piranha swimming in a mixing bowl
Paper is full of stabbings, the sky is full of crows
She's singing in Italian while she's hanging out her clothes
Carp in the bathtub and it's raining real hard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I said that I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
Well a sailor's ringing doorbells, the sinner's in the pew
Weather vane squeaking to the west
I seen the cliffs of Dover and the deepest ocean blue
One thing in the world I can't recommend to you
'Cause I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed
No I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I said I ain't allowed
No, I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yardEmbed
