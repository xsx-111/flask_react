The Return of Jackie and Judy LyricsOh-yeah
Oh-yeah
Jackie is a punk
And Judy is a runt
They went down to The Mudd Club
And they both got drunk
Oh-yeah
Oh-yeah
Jackie is a bookie
And Judy's taking loans
They both came up to New York
Just to see The Ramones
Oh-yeah
Oh-yeah
Oh I don't know why
She wrote that letter
I don't know why
We can't forget her
Oh-no
Jackie's playing hooky
Judy's playing pool
They both got caught for cutting
Now they're going to summer school
Oh-yeah
Jackie's playing hooky
Judy's getting rammed
They both got kicked outside
They ain't got no time
Na na na
Oh-yeah
Oh-yeah
Oh I don't know why
She wrote that letter
Oh yeah
I don't know why
We can't forget her
Oh-no
Oh-yeah
Oh-yeah
Jackie is a punk
And Judy is a runt
They went down to The Mudd Club
And they both got drunk
Oh-yeah
Oh-yeah
Now Jackie's playing hooky
Judy's playing pool
They both got caught for cutting
Now they're going to summer school
Oh-yeah1Embed
