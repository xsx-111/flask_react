Fannin Street LyricsThere's a crooked street in Houston Town
It's a well-worn path I've traveled down
Now there's ruin in my name
I wish I'd never got off the train
And I wish I'd listened to the words you said
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street, oh yeah
You'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Once I held you in my arms, I was sure
Then I took that silent step through the gilded door
But the desire to have much more
All the glitter and the roar
Now I know just where the sidewalk ends
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street, oh yeah
You'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street
When I was young, I thought only of getting out
I said goodbye to my street, goodbye to my house
Give a man gin, give a man cards
Give him an inch, he takes a yard
And I rue the day that I stepped off this train
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street, oh yeah
You'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
'Cause you'll be lost and never found
You can never turn around
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street
Don't go down to Fannin Street2Embed
