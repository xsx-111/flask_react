Tell It to Me LyricsThey say you're seeing someone
You're wearing his ring
They say you laughed when you heard my name
They say he takes you dancing
He holds you so near
They say he'll buy you anything
Tell me am I foolish?
I don't believe these stories
And I'll be coming home soon
Louise, Louise, if it's true
Tell it to me
I know you will not see me
But I know you have a daughter
And I hear she has my eyes
They say she calls him father
And he's proud of her
And he believes all your lies
But for all your faithless beauty
I'd give all my tomorrows
And if you're still thinking of me
Louise, Louise, if it's true
Tell it to me
Louise, Louise, if it's true
Tell it to me
Louise, Louise, if it's true
Tell it to meEmbed
