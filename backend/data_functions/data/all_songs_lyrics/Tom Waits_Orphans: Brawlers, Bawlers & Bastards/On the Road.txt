On the Road LyricsI left New York
In nineteen forty-nine
To go across the country
Without a dad-blamed dime
Montana in the cold, cold fall
Found my father in a gambling hall
Father father
Where have you been
I've been out in the world
Since I was only ten
Father father
Where have you been
I've been out in the world
Since I was only ten
Don't worry about me
About to die of pleurisy
Cross the Mississippi
Cross the Tennessee
Cross the Niobrara
Home I'll never be
Home in old Medora
Home in ol' Truckee
Apalachicola
Home I'll never be
For better or for worse
Or thick and thin
Like being married to the little woman
God he loves me
Like I love him
I want you to do
Just the same for him
Well the worms eat away
But the worrywarts will win
So I left Montana
On an old freight train
The night my father died
In the cold, cold rain
Road to Opelousas
Road to Wounded Knee
Road to Ogallala
Home I'll never be
Road to Oklahoma
Road to El Cajon
Road to old Tehatchapi
Road to San Antone
Hey hey
Road to Opelousas
Road to Wounded Knee
Road to Ogallala
Home I'll never be
Road to Oklahoma
Road to El Cajon
Road to old Tehatchapi
Road to San Antone
Home I'll never beEmbed
