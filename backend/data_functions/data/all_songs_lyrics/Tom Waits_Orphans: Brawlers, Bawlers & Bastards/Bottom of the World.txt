Bottom of the World LyricsMy daddy told me, lookin' back
The best friend you'll have is a railroad track
So when I was thirteen I said, "I'm rollin' my own
And I'm leavin' Missouri and I'm never comin' home"
And I'm lost
And I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Satchel Puddin' and Lord God Mose
Sitting by the fire with a busted nose
That fresh egg yeller is too damn rare
But the white part is perfect for slicking down your hair
And I'm lost
And I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain
The moon is the color of a coffee stain
Jesse Frank and Birdy Jo Hoaks
But who is the king of all of these folks?
And I'm lost
And I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Well I dined last night with Scarface Ron
On tilapia fish cakes and fried black swan
Razor weed onion and peacock squirrel
And I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl
And I'm lost
And I'm lost
And I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Well God's green hair is where I slept last
He balanced a diamond on a blade of grass
Now I woke me up with a cardinal bird
And when I wanna talk, he hangs on every word
And I'm lost
And I'm lost
And I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the worldEmbed
