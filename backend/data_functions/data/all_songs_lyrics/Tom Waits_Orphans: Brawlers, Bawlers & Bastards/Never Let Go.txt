Never Let Go LyricsWell, ring the bell backwards, and bury the axe
Fall down on your knees in the dirt
I'm tied to the mast between water and wind
Believe me, you'll never get hurt
Now the ring's in the pawnshop
The rain's in the hole, down at the Five Points I stand
I'll lose everything, but I won't let go of your hand
Now Peter denied and Judas betrayed
I'll pay with the roll of the drum
The wind will tell the turn from the wheel
And the watchman is making his rounds
Well, you leave me hanging by the skin of my teeth
I've only got one leg to stand
You can send me to hell
But I'll never let go of your hand
Swing from a rope on a cross-legged tree
Signed with the one-eyed jack's blood
From Temple and Union to Weyley and Grand
Walking back home in the mud
I must make my best of the only way home
Marley deals only in stones
I'm lost on the midway, I'm reckless in your eyes
Just give me a couple more throws
I'll dare you to dine with the cross-legged knights
Dare me to jump and I will
I'll fall from your grace
But I'll never let go of your hand
I'll never let go of your handEmbed
