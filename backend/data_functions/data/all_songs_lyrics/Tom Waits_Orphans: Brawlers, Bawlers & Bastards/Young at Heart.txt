Young at Heart LyricsFairy tales can come true it can happen to you
If you're young at heart
For it's hard you will find
To be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on its way
Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
And as rich as you are it's much better by far
To be young at heart
And if you should survive to 105
Think of all you'll derive out of being alive
Then this is the best part
You have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart
Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
Or as rich as you are it's much better by far
To be young at heart
And if you should survive to 105
Think of all you've derived out of being alive
Then this is the best part
You have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart
If you are among the very young at heartEmbed
