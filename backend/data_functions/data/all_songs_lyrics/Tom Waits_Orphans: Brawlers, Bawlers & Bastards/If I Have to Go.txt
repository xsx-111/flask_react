If I Have to Go LyricsAnd if I have to go
Will you remember me
Will you find someone else
While I'm away
There's nothing for me in this world full of strangers
It's all someone else's idea
I don't belong here and you can't go with me
You'll only slow me down
Until I send for you
Don't wear your hair that way
If you cannot be true
I'll understand
Tell all the others you'll hold in your arms
I said I'd come back for you
I'll leave my jacket to keep you warm
That's all that I can do
And if I have to go
Will you remember me
Or will you find someone else
While I'm awayEmbed
