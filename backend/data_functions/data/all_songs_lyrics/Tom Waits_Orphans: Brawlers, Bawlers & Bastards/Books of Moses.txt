Books of Moses LyricsBooks of Moses
Bringing stone news
Wet in the water
Weeping in the sun
Books of Moses
Got some splinters
Didn't you?
Books of Moses
Brought me right here
Back to you
Flaming heart
Ain't it sweet
Lighting the world
At your feet
Books of Moses
Myth and truth
Books of Moses
Bring me back to you
Hero's welcome
There stands your king
Where the serpent shudders
And the angels sing
Books of Moses
Happening again
Yes he knows us
Well welcome him
Your friend
Books of Moses
Bringing stone news
Wet is the water
Blood covering the sun
Books of Moses
Myth and truth
Books of Moses
Bring me back to youEmbed
