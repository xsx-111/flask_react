Lucinda LyricsWell, they call me William the Pleaser
I sold opium, fireworks and lead
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
When the shadows get long, I'll be dead
Now her hair was just as black as a bucket of tar
Her skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
Now I'll never see Heaven or home
I made a wish on a sliver of moonlight
A sly grin and a bowl full of stars
Like a kid who captures a firefly
And leaves it only to die in the jar
As I kick at the clouds at my hanging
As I swing out over the crowd
I will search every face for Lucinda's
And she will go off with me down to hell
I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda
Rain returned and so did the wind
I cast this burden on the God that's within me
And I'll leave this old world and go free
The devil dances inside empty pockets
But she didn't want money or pearls
No, that wasn't enough for Lucinda
She wasn't that kind of girl
Now I've fallen from grace for Lucinda
Whoever thought that hell'd be so cold?
I did well for an old tin can sailor
But she wanted the bell in my soul
I've spoken to God on the mountain
I've swam in the Irish Sea
I ate fire and drank from the Ganges
And I'll beg there for mercy for me
I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda
The rain returned and so did the wind
I was standing outside the Whitehorse
And man, I was afraid to go in
I heard someone pull the trigger
Her breasts heaved in the moonlight again
There was a smear of gold in the window
And then I was the jewel of her sin
They call me William the Pleaser
I sold opium, fireworks and lead
Now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
When the shadows get long, I'll be dead
Now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar
Skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
I know I'll never see Heaven or home
Know I'll never see Heaven or home
I know I'll never see Heaven or homeEmbed
