LowDown LyricsShe is a crooked sheriff in a real straight town
She opened the door, shake shake, the lights go down
Clover honey and the jimson weed
Red leather skirt way up above her knees
Oh yeah my baby is lowdown
She's a gone lost dirt road
There ain't no way back, I've been told
She's a story they all tell
She's a rebel, she's a yell
Oh yeah my baby is lowdown
White heat in a cold rain
I'm merging here in your merging lane
Jockey LaFayette, Big-Eyed Al
The secondhand moon is shining for my gal
She is a big red flag in a mean bullpen
She'll steal it from you, sell it right back to you again
Well she's a wild rose, she is not settled
Cold gun of ice blue metal
Oh yeah my baby is lowdown
White heat in a cold rain
I'm merging here in your merging lane
Jockey LaFayette, Big-Eyed Al
The secondhand moon is shining for my gal
She's a cheap motel with a burned-out sign
She'll take care of you definitely every time
She got a stolen checkbook and legs up to here
Singing into a hairbrush right in front of the mirror
Oh yeah my baby is lowdown
Oh yeah my baby is lowdown
Uh huh my baby is lowdownEmbed
