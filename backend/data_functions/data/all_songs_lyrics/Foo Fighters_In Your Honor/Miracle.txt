Miracle Lyrics
Crazy but I'm relieved this time
Begging for sweet relief
A blessing in disguise
Dying behind these tired eyes
I've been losing sleep
Please come to me
Tonight

Hands on a miracle
I got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
Let you take it away

Everything that we survived
It's gonna be alright
Just lucky we're alive
Got no vision I've been blind
Searching everywhere you're right here in my sights

Hands on a miracle
I got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
Let you take it away

Hands on a miracle
I got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
I got my hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
Let you take it away
Take it away1Embed
