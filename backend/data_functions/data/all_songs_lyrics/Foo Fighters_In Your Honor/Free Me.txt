Free Me Lyrics
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, yeah

Beautiful prisoner, left here for dead
Promises made and sentences read
Voices and visions are locked in my head
Like a safe full of sorrow
All of the words that we damn never speak
All of our ghosts and the secrets we keep
Gather them all we'll bury them deep
Like a safe full of sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me

One for forever
One in your name
One to remember
We're one and the same
One to forget but it always remains
Like a safe full of sorrow
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me

Could you free what's keepin' you
Well I need somebody too

Free me! Free me
Free me! Free me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me

Could you free what's keepin' you
Well I need somebody too
Free me! Free me
Free me! Free me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeahEmbed
