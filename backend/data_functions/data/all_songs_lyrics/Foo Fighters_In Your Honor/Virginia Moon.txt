Virginia Moon Lyrics
Dearest constellation, heaven surrounding you
Stay there, soft and blue. Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight
Sweetest invitation, breaking the day in two
Feeling like I do, Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you
I will say goodnight

Secret fascination, whisper a quiet tune
Hear me calling you, Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight


Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight


I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight2Embed
