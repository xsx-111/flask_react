Cut Me Down LyricsI've been bought and sold and
I've been hung upside down
So you can hear me breathing
Do you think it's easy?
I've been aching all through summer
I've been aching, just to fall
Cut me down
I've been Billy Name and
Filled my pockets with sand
I've seen everything
I hang upon your pretty frown
I have wasted all my summer
I've been aching, just to fall
Cut me down
All she had too much class to mention
Were the things he never knew
All the things she left unspoken
Were the things he needed so
(I'm not hurting anymore)
I've been bought and sold
And I've been hung upside down
Can you hear me breathing
Do you think it's easy?
I may find it hard to follow
I've been aching, just to fall
Cut me downEmbed
