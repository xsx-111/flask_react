Grace LyricsJesse honey, is it hard to take
Does it feel so bad to be 28
You were 23 and you could do anything
Now, you open your mouth
And spit the gutter out
I was walking down by the River Thames
I decided that I should throw me in
Because you broke my heart
And you made me weep
In the name of your sensitivity
Still, once you were an angel
Did nobody tell you?
Jesse honey, oh you look so pale and old
And so very ill at ease, these days
So you tell yourself that you'll never win
And you drown your sins in amphetamine
Do you weary so of that bitter taste
So you spit it in my face
Just to keep you entertained
Well, I can only love you
I have no option but to
Is it hard to take, is it?
Is it hard to swallow, is it?
Is it hard to take from Grace?
Once you were an angel
Did nobody tell you?
Jesse honey, is it hard to take
Does it feel so bad to be 28
You were 23 and you could do anything
Now, you open your mouth
And you spit the gutter out
Out in the summer rain
You will begin again
Out in the summer rain
We will begin againEmbed
