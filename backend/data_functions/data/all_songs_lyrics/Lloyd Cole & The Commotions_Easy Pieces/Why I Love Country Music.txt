Why I Love Country Music LyricsJane is fine, always fine
We're unhappy most of the time
We don't talk, we don't fight
I'm just tired, she's way past caring
But she says, she is fine
She tells lies most of the time
What she needs, I don't have
That's not in the hand that I'm holding
So we drink spanish wine
She plays country records until the morning
This is mine, all of mine
She is not, she is not mine
But I feel fine
Only when I'm sleeping
Only with the tv on
She and I and empty wine and whisky bottles
And she white beneath crumpled sheets
She is everything I need
But she would rather be
Any place but here
Jane is fine, always fine
We're unhappy most of the time
We don't talk, we don't fight
I'm just tired, she's way past caring
So we drink spanish wine
We tell lies, we're killing time
And we feel fine
Well, what's the crime?Embed
