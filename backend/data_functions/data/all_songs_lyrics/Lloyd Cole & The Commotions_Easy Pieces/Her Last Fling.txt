Her Last Fling LyricsThere you go again
Alma tell me when
Will you never learn?
Now you're underweight and overpaid
You will not be saved
And you're pushing thirty eight
Heaven knows your train is late
Although my chance is slim
You perceive the state you're in
Is good for one last fling
In a drastic dress
You walk in drastic steps
Creating no interest
No, it seems you won't be spared
And you were so much wiser unaware
Independent means
Being alone and being
Good for one last fling
So there you go again
Alma tell me when
Will you ever learn?
Still you walk in these drastic steps
When you know too well your train has left
Your train has leftEmbed
