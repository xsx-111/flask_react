Perfect Blue LyricsShould you awake, dear, from your beauty sleep
To find your room swimming in blue and green
Should you awake to feel like you never slept
And feel so very old
Well, don't you feel alone
I'm kind of blue
Blue for you again
I guess I'm a fool
At least I'm not innocent
But what to do?
Whatever I touch turns blue
And should you find yourself lost
But in no need of sympathy
Calm down to the beach and watch the waves come in
I dream the ocean was in my house
I feel the surf against my skin
I just can't keep the waves from dragging me down
But when you say ooh
Baby, you're my best friend
Then I lose
I lose my common sense
I'm blue
I'm kind of blue
It's the truth
Should you awake, dear, from your beauty sleep
To find your room swimming in blue and green
Should you awake to feel like you never slept
And feel so very old
Well, don't you feel alone
I'm kind of blue
Blue for you again
I guess I'm a fool
At least I'm not innocent
I may be blue
But don't you let me make you blue tooEmbed
