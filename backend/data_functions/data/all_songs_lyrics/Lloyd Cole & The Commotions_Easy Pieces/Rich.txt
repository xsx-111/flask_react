Rich LyricsShe left you 1958
When the thought of another fifteen years
Was more than she could face
But did you miss her much well hey
You never gave her too much thought
In your newspaper grey
So waste away to Morro Bay
You never got around to yesterday
But money is for taking yes and
Rich is what to be forsaken grey
And giving it away
And even Jesus has a price
You're making credit card donations
To television faith healers
Born again missionaries come to Morro Bay
They saved your body but your mind hey
And everything you earned you're going to throw it all away
And waste away tomorrow
C.A. is where everybody falls
Down off the wagon under the wheels
Remember 1970?
When the thought of a day without a drink
Was more than you could face
But did you miss her much well hey
You never gave her too much thought
In your newspaper grey
So waste away to Morro Bay
You never got around to yesterday
But money is for taking yes and
Rich is what to be forsaken grey
And giving it away
You're going to hurt somebody it you can
You're going to make somebody understand
Baby you're a rich manEmbed
