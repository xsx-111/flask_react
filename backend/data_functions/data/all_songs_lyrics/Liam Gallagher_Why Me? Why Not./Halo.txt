Halo Lyrics
People ask me, "What you mean, boy?"
All the time (Yeah)
Nobody can follow me but
I don't mind
I'm good with my baby
She turns me on
She's fillin' up my sky like a halo 'round the sun

People grabbin' things off me but
It's alright
Don't know who they want to be but
It's alright
I'm good with my baby
She's all that I want
She's fillin' up my sky like a halo 'round the sun

When it's freezing, she's my mittens and my coat
When I get too hot, she's my lager nice and cold
Wanna lock her up and keep her till I'm old

I can get a little better
Follow her lead to the letter
We can bang a gong forever

And I know it's her who's knocking at my door
Yeah, she's teaching me that two plus two is four
When the well goes dry, she always gives me more

I can get a little better
Follow her lead to the letter
We can bang a gong forever


People ask me what you mean, boy
All the time (Yeah)
Nobody can follow me but
I don't mind
I'm good with my baby
She turns me on
Follows me 'round all day like a halo 'round the sun
She's fillin' up my sky like a halo 'round the sun
Follows me 'round all day like a halo 'round the sun
'Round the sun
'Round the sun
'Round the sun
'Round the sun
'Round the sun
'Round the sun
'Round the sun
'Round the sun
'Round the sunEmbed
