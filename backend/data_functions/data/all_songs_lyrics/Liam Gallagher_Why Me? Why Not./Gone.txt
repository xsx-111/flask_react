Gone Lyrics
Well, the changing of the guard is oh, so real
But before I go, I wanna tell you how I feel
I gave you the chance to build a life worth living
But you cut off the love like a vine that can never grow back
Oh, I used to go away
And come back, back another day
But now I don't know how long

I'm gonna be gone
Yeah, yeah
But I'm gonna be gone
Yeah, yeah

Well, I hung on like a dog for life and limb
And the burning house casts shapes upon the scrim
I gave you the chance to build a life worth building
But you smashed all the plants up, and now they can never grow back

You had fun stringing me along
But oh, now playing, you were wrong
But now I don't know how long
I'm gonna be gone
Yeah, yeah
But I'm gonna be gone
Yeah, yeah

Now woman, I wanna tell you something
I ain't never seen the likes of you before
So I was willing to stand still while you pushed me
But you finally pushed me out the door
So I wanna hear you say it (Say it, yeah)
Yeah, I wanna hear you beg me (Beggin', yeah)

Oh, I used to go away
And come back, back another day
But now I don't know how long

I'm gonna be gone
Yeah, yeah
But I'm gonna be gone
Yeah, yeah
But I'm gonna be gone
Yeah, yeah
But I'm gonna be gone
Yeah, yeah
