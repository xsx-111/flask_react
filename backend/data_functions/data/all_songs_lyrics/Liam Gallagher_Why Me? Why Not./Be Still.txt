Be Still Lyrics
Up on the altar of sacrifice
Can't get in the habit of thinkin' twice
Lit up my heart in a funeral blaze
Gotta live for something beside yesterdays

I've been waiting for this moment for too long

My mama said, "Keep moving
Though you're down, you're gonna rise again
Come on, darling, don't get in your head
You know you know the wheel's still in spin
Even though your heart is breaking
And the changes all keep changing
You be still"

You can try me 'til kingdom come
I got a heart like a beating drum
I see hearts on my lightning, they're the crack in the sky
Jump out of the trench, boys, you were born to die

I been waiting for this moment for too long
My mama said, "Keep moving
Though you're down, you're gonna rise again
Come on, darling, don't get in your head
You know you know the wheel's still in spin
Even though your heart is breaking
And the changes all keep changing
You be still"


My mama said, "Keep moving
Though you're down, you're gonna rise again
Come on, darling, don't get in your head
You know you know the wheel's still in spin
Even though your heart is breaking
And the changes all keep changing
You be still"Embed
