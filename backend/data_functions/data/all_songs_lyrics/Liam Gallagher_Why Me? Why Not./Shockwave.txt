Shockwave Lyrics
You sold me right up the river
You had to hold me back
You coulda looked for the sunshine, yeah
But you had to paint the whole thing black
Now I'm back in the city
The lights are up on me
They try to keep me locked away
But, hallelujah, I feel free

All your darkness has come back to you in time
Brace yourself, world, it's about to blow your mind

It's comin' 'round like a shockwave, hey
It's comin' 'round like a shockwave, hey
You've played the game one too many times
You're gonna burn until you behave, hey
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
It's comin' 'round like a shockwave

You made your bed all pretty
You reap what you sow
Backstabbed all your friends
And, yes, it's all about who you know
So don't you dare look my way
To try to make you cry
I don't have to do a thing to you
'Cause it's coming from the starry sky
All your darkness has come back to you in time
Brace yourself world, it's about to blow your mind

It's comin' 'round like a shockwave, hey
It's comin' 'round like a shockwave, hey
You've played the game one too many times
You're gonna burn until you behave, hey
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
It's comin' 'round like a shockwave, hey

You’re a snake
You’re a weasel
You’re a pebble in the sea
And the pain you feel
Is washing over me

It's comin' 'round like a shockwave, hey
It's comin' 'round like a shockwave, hey
You've played the game one too many times
You're gonna burn until you behave, hey
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
Maybe the shame will open your eyes
It's comin' 'round like a shockwave4Embed
