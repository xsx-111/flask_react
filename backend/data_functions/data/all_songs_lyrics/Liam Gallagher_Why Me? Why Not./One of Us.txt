One of Us Lyrics
Hey kid, did you know?
Today 16 years ago
It was you and I for the last time
You angrily said
With a smoke ring 'round your head
You would see me on the other side

C'mon, I know you want more
C'mon and open your door
After it all, you'll find out
You were always one of us
Act like you don't remember
You said we'd live forever
Who do you think you're kidding?
You were only one of us
In time

When you come to mind
Disappear a thousand times
Keep me hanging on to the old life
Well, I've gotta go
Maybe see you down the road
Won't you tell the kid I said goodbye
C'mon, I know you want more
C'mon and open your door
After it all you'll find out
You were always one of us
Act like you don't remember
You said we'd live forever
End up at the beginning
You were only one of us
In time

In
In

C'mon, I know you want more
C'mon and open your door
After it all, you'll find out
You were always one of us
Act like you don't remember
You said we'd live forever
End up at the beginning
You were only one of us
In time

(It's a shame, a shame)
(You thought you'd change, my friend)
(But you were always one of us)
(It's a shame, a shame)
(You thought you'd change, my friend)
(But you were always one of us)4Embed
