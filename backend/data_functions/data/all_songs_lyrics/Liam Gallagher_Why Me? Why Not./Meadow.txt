Meadow Lyrics
Think I’m coming down with something
I’ve begun to feel a chill
Woman, I said that I would get to know ya
And I will

The rain is blowing at your window
And you’ve come so many miles
But, hold still, don’t try to fight the shadows
In your mind

It’s a long, long, long lonely life
Sometimes you gotta hold your head up high
If you want to break the chains from your past life
My dear, don’t you worry no more

Let me find an empty meadow
Where the snow falls on the grass
Nothing real can ever fade from memory
But nothing lasts

It’s a long, long, long lonely life
Sometimes you gotta hold your head up high
If you want to break the chains from your past life
My dear, don’t you worry no more

It’s a long, long, long lonely life
Sometimes you gotta hold your head up high
If you want to break the chains from your past life
My dear, don’t you worry no more
