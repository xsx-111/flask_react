The River Lyrics
Well, come on, you're weak of knees
Afraid of the thought police
You who say our generation is forsaken
Get out of your clouds of weed
Get out of your time machines
You can say that the sleeper has awakened

You gotta scream and shout
If you’re gonna work this out
Change comes when the water falls
I've been waiting so long for you down by the river

Well, the walls are closing in
And your head's in constant spin
And the pain in your eyes, I do comprehend
Don’t believe celebrities
The money-suckin' MPs
The device in your hands, imitation beauty

You gotta scream and shout
If you're gonna work this out
Change comes when the water falls
I've been waiting so long for you down by the river
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)

Lick your lips like a prized fighter
Surely you can take a punch
Your knuckles can't get no whiter
They're gonna eat you for lunch, boy
So, come on

You gotta scream and shout
If you're gonna work this out
Change comes when the water falls
I've been waiting for you to come down by the riverEmbed
