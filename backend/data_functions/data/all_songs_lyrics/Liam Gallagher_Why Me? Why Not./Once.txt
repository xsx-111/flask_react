Once Lyrics
It was easier to have fun back when we had nothing
Nothing much to manage
Back when we were damaged
Sometimes the freedom we wanted feels so uncool
Just clean the pool
And send the kids to school

But oh, I remember how you used to shine back then
You went down so easy like a glass of wine, my friend
When the dawn came up, you felt so inspired to do it again
But it turns out you only get to do it once

I think it's true what they say that the dream is borrowed
You give it back tomorrow
Minus the sorrow
And the pain she just comes in to break up the daydream
Her knife edges waving
To keep from feeling the same thing

But oh, l remember how you used to shine back then
You went down so easy like a glass of wine, my friend
When the dawn came up, you felt so inspired to do it again
But it turns out you only get to do it once
You only get to do it once
You only get to do it once
You only get to do it once


But oh, I remember how you used to shine back then
You went down so easy like a glass of wine, my friend
When the dawn came up, you felt so inspired to do it again
But we were wrong, you only get to do it once8Embed
