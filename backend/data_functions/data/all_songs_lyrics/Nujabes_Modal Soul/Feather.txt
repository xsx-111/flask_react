Feather Lyrics
Light as a feather when I'm floating through
Reading through the daily news
Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
Centimetres of ether, I'm heating the speaker
Motivational teacher with words that burn people
Seeing the headlines lined with discord
It's either genocide or the planet in uproar
Never good.  The rules of paradise are never nice
The best laid plans of Mice and Men are never right
I'm just a Vagabond with Flowers for Algernon
An Average Joe who knows what the fuck is going on
It's the hope of my thoughts that I travel upon
Fly like an arrow of God until I'm gone, so I'm

Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater, so I'm
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater

Taking chances, word tap dancing with wolves
In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of
Arizona, the sun be high, life's ironic
Ain't trying to be Dalí when I write surreal life
I paint it vivid, habitat crazy insane
Watch the propaganda six o'clock news and it’s saying
Cultures clash, for black folk and white trash
They revel in the cyberspace that might crash, dash
To millennium a million miles of running
At the speed of now back, don't return gunning
Rambo style, gung ho child gunning
Ammo blao two times loud stunning
Stunning, when I hit ya, lift you off the Earth like
Ayo, take you right back to birth and
Niggas wonder why, they might wonder why
This shit might happen but it does, they go
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater, so I'm
Drifting away like a feather in air
Letting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
Riding the escalator to reach something that is greater

Treat you better than me, cause that's the heavenly key
To unlock the inner strength where my essence will be
It's the knowledge of self, understanding of the things around me
That becomes the wisdom that I need
Living this life to the best of my ability
Channeling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
Remember me, because my prose remain gold
I got the gift of gab like them pimps in Kangol
It never ends, I keep it ruling like a cypher
The first caveman bringing fire
Innovating and higher; to blast mistakes I raise the stakes
It's double or nothing in this vaccuum space
I will, survive, divine the time to cry
Fuck a hold or hide, I'm alive with pride
And I drove the Chevy to the Levy
But the Levy was dry, singing "This will be the day that I die"67Embed
