Nega maluca / Billie Jean / Eleanor Rigby Lyrics
Tava jogando sinuca
Uma nega maluca me apareceu
Vinha com um filho no colo
E dizia pro povo que o filho era meu

She's more like a beauty queen
From a movie screen
I said: "Don't mind, but what do mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round!"
She said: "I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round!"

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes
That dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me: "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts!"
And mother always told me: "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth!"

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Just think twice)

She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the around baby

People always told me: "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts!"
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
That happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely peopleEmbed
