Am I Going Insane (Radio) Lyrics
Everybody’s looking at me
Feeling paranoid inside
When I step outside, I’ll feel free
Think I’ll find a place to hide

Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?

Every day, I sit and wonder
How my life it used to be
Now, I feel like going under
Now, my life is hard to see

So, tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?

So, I’m telling all you people
Listen while I sing again
If I don’t sound very cheerful
I think that I’m a schizophrene

So, tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?
Tell me, people
Am I going insane—insane?Embed
