Pyongyang Lyrics
I look down from my window
To the island where I'm held
They listen while you're sleeping
And darkness is itself
Tomorrow, I'm disappearing
'Cause the trees are amplified
The never-ending broadcast
To which I do not aspire

Kid, the mausoleum's fallen
And the perfect avenues
Will seem empty without you
The pink light that bathed the great leaders is fading
By the time your sun is rising there
Out here, it's turning blue
The silver rockets coming
And the cherry trees of Pyongyang, I'm leaving

I feel like I'm floating
Processed in Auto-Tune
The never ending roll on
To the palace of the doomed
Temperature keeps falling
Soon there will be no lights
Just a red glow, glass coffin
Watched by someone through the night
Kid, the mausoleum's fallen
And the perfect avenues
Will seem empty without you
And the pink light that bathed the great leaders is fading
By the time your sun is rising there
Out here, it's turning blue
The silver rockets coming
And the cherry trees of Pyongyang, I'm leaving

There will be no light
Someone through the night
Someone through the night
Kid, the mausoleum's fallen
And the perfect avenues
Will seem empty without you
And the pink light that bathed the great leaders is fading
By the time your sun is rising there
(Years ago, when we used to be rivals)
Out here, it's turning blue
The silver rockets coming
(Our youths' minds and arms were bound)
And the cherry trees of Pyongyang, I'm leaving
(For our own survival)
Compliance is over
Reality is fables, fables
Ensuring humour, time's child
Ask still, Seoul8Embed
