I Broadcast Lyrics
I love the aspects of another city
The representatives are alright
In circulation, the snake and the tiger
Waking up clean-shaven in industrial light

I broadcast, buzzing on another day now
All for a cold sore, something out of nothing

I love the aspects of another city
It's got your number and your blood type
Living in Tetris, I need soft focus
The apparitions of another bloody good night, right?

I broadcast, buzzing on another day now
All for a high score, something out of nothing

I broadcast
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running (Fuck yeah!)

I broadcast, buzzing on another day now
All for a cold sore, something out of nothing

I broadcast, buzzing on another day now
All for a cold sore, something out of nothing2Embed
