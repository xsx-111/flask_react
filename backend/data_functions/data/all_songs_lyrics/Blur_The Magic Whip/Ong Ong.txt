Ong Ong Lyrics
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la

I got on a boat on a hot sunny day
To get out of this town
'Cause the tarmac was melting and the people seem to sway
Stuck in the underground

To the islands, the black kites, the wishing tree
I wanna be with you
On a slow boat to Lantau, the misty seas
I wanna be with you

I crawled out the harbour with recession behind
And now I'm feeling the love of you
So you better get a charge 'til I see you again
You'll know just what to do

If you're caught up in the gales on the junk boat seas
I wanna be with you
With the pilgrims, the mountain, the High Trappist
I wanna be with you

If you're the landlord, the social on BST
I wanna be with you
On an island with red kites and verdant seas
I will be there with you, oh7Embed
