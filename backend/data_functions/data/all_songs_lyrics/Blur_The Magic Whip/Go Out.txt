Go Out Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh

I get a set alone
Dancing with myself
Greedy go-getter gone
The luxury of stealth
Obsidian the ha-a-a-a-a-all
Dancing with myself
I get into my bed
I do it to myself

To the local (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
To the lo-o-o, I go out (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
To the lo-o-o-o-ocal, by myself (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
To the lo-o-o-o-ocal (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

I get into my head
There's nothing to be addressed now
There's nothing to get up about
'Cause we do it all the time
The shepherdess undone
She done it all again
I get ready to go
The greed go-getter come
He going to the local (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
He going to the local-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
He going to the lo-o-o-o-ocal (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
He going to the lo-o-o-o-ocal (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

Too many Western men
Top button left undone
Imperious their signs
The pedlars of luxury
A greedy go-getter in the sky bar
She on her own
She get ready to go
She does it with herself

She does it with herself (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
She does it with herself (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
She does it on her o-o-o-o-o-own (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
She does it on her o-o-o-o-o-own (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)8Embed
