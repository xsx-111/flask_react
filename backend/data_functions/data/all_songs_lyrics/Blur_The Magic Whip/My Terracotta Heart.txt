My Terracotta Heart Lyrics
And the bright rays we got in summertime
Seemed like a breath of fresh air back in the summertime
When we were more like brothers, but that was years ago
So if it doesnâ€™t seem like a protocol

I'm running out of heart today
I'm running out of open road to you
And I know you are emoting and you're dazed
Is something broke inside you?
'Cause at the moment I'm lost
And feeling that I don't know if I'm losing you again

And when we fly tomorrow over the Java seas
And my younger maps will be there with me
'Cause they remind me of swimming out too far one day
Then the coral was gone, but I didn't care anyway

I was running out of heart that day
I was running out of open road to you
And I know I was emoting, I was dazed
Is something broke inside me?
'Cause at the moment I'm lost
And feeling that I don't know if I'm losing you again
I'm running out of heart here
Just sitting out the constant doubt in my head
But I don't know what it is
I'm sweating out the toxins
Is my terracotta heart breaking?
I don't know if I'm losing you, if I'm losing you again20Embed
