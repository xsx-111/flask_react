Lonesome Street Lyrics
What do you got?
Mass produced in somewhere hot
You'll have to go on the Underground
To get things done here
(And then you have to see)
If you need a yellow duck, service done
This is a place to come to, or, well, it was
Another hot spot, oh, oh
Crossing on the guillotine

And if you have nobody left to rely on
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift
It's got to be that time again
And June, June will be over soon again

So get yourself up, get a pass glitch on your way
It's nothing to be ashamed of
Taking off again
The 5:14 to East Grinstead
(You've sent me off to see)
And we go up, up, up, up, up
Coursing on our greatest night
And talking types will let us down again
Talk, talk on your arse all night
You wanna be there
Step inside the tarmac ride
To the land that crime forgot
Oh, just donâ€™t go there
Cracks inside the tarmac ride
To the land that crime forgot, oh no

And if you have nobody left to rely on
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift

Going down to Lonesome Street
Going down to Lonesome Street
Lonesome Street
Going down to Lonesome Street
Lonesome Street
Lonesome Street
Going down to Lonesome Street19Embed
