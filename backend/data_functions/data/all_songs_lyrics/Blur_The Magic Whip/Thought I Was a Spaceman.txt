Thought I Was a Spaceman Lyrics
Thought I was a spaceman digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes in a car park
'Cause the desert had encroached upon the places where we lived
People like me fight to keep the demons in
But we never succeeded, we never succeeded
In fact, we failed

Thought I was a spaceman digging out my heart
In some distant sand dune in a car park
By the empty harbour where the junk boat phantoms float
The fight for Happy Valley
Sadly, the line broke

Thought I found my black box washed up on the shore
On outlying islands past the land fall
Thought I'd thought I'd found it but that was not true at all
I'd walked into a bar, raised hell

Cut the chasm out me, always and always the same
Put the ghost in writing and let it be (You again)
Thought I was a spaceman digging out my heart
In some distant sand dune in Hyde Park

Thought I was a spaceman digging out my heart
In some distant sand dune, you again
Thought I was a spaceman digging out my heart
In some distant sand dune, you again, you again, you again
