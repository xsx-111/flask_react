Ice Cream Man Lyrics
Here comes the ice cream man, parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip, all the people in the party froze
Screwball, chocolate chip, umbrella in his white glove hand
Shade from the sun was his intention

Here comes the ice cream man, bouncing up the hill
With a wick, the pumpkin lit, Happy Valley cones he fills for
All the lantern men, marching down till dawn
Morning come, we fall over

Something new
Something you
Something new


Here comes the ice cream man, parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip, all the people in the party froze
I was only twenty-one when I watched it on TV
I was racing in my heart back then

Something new (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Something new
Something new (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Something new (Something you do nothing about)
Something new (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Something new
(Here comes the ice cream man, out with his magic whip)
Something new
(Always sold out by nine, so you better come and get it quick)
Something new (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
