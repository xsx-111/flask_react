New World Towers Lyrics
Green, green, the neon green, new world towers
Carved out of grey white skies, twenty-four hours
Glide through the glass arcade to Hollywood
The psychopomp, it leads me dreaming

Of love, love, so far away, new world towers (Seven on me)
Log in your name and pray, twenty-four hours (Seven on me)
Green turns to red and blue and time relates (Seven on me)
To us all again (Seven on a left-hand side)
And sleep the rescue (Seven on me)

Green, green, the neon green, new world towers (Seven on me)
Plane flying overhead, satellite showers (Seven on me)
Fall like confetti on the cavalcade (Seven on me)
The flashboat seas (Seven on a left-hand side)
All auguries (Seven on me)
Reflected in you (Seven on a left-hand side)

Seven on me
Seven on a left-hand side
Seven on me
Seven on me
Love, love, so far away, new world towers
Carved out of grey white sky, twenty-four hours
Green turns to red and blue and time relates (Seven on me)
The flashboat seas (Seven on a left-hand side)
All auguries (Seven on me)
Reflected in you (Seven on a left-hand side)

Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on a left-hand side
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on me
Seven on a left-hand side
Seven on me4Embed
