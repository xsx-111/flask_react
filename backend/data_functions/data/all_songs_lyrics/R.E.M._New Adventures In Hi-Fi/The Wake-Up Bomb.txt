The Wake-Up Bomb Lyrics
I look good in a glass pack, I look good and mean
I look good in metallic sick wraparound and blackout tease
I scud along the horizon, I drink some sweet tree tea
I get high in my low-ass boot-cut jean, I like being seen
I look good in my drink-eat-no-sleep, take-a-leap longevity
I get high on my attitude, latitude, 1973
Oh, I'm in deep

My head's on fire and high esteem
Carry my dead bored, "been there, done that" anything

Oh, wake-up bomb
Oh, wake-up bomb
Oh, wake-up bomb
Oh, wake-up bomb
My head's on fire and high esteem
Get drunk and sing along to Queen
Practice my T-Rex moves and make the scene
Carry my dead bored, "been there, done that" anything

I had to knock a few buildings over, I make an ugly mess
I had to blow a gasket, drop transmission, I had to decompress
I had to write the great American novel, I had a neutron bomb
I had to teach the world to sing by the age of 21
I wake up (Wake up), I wake up (Wake up)
I threw up when I saw what I'd done
Oh, wake-up bomb
Oh, wake-up bomb
My head's on fire and high esteem
Get drunk and sing along to Queen
Practice my T-Rex moves and make the scene
Oh, I'd rather be anywhere, doing anything

I've had enough, I've seen enough, I've had it all, I'm giving up
I won the race, I broke the cup, I drank it all, I spit it up
I've had enough, I've seen enough, I've had it all, I'm giving up
I won the race, I broke the cup, I drank it all, I spit it up
Yeah, atomic, supersonic, what a joke, oh, I'm dumb
See you, d-don't want to be you, you lunch meat, pond scum

My head's on fire in high esteem
Get drunk and sing along to Queen
Practice my T-Rex moves and make the scene
Yooh, I'd rather be anywhere doing anything
Yeah, I'd rather be anywhere doing anything
Yeah, I'd rather be anywhere doing anything
Yeah....1Embed
