Undertow Lyrics
I know what I wanted
I know what I wanted
I know how I wanted this to be
You go down to the water
Drink down of the water
Walk up off the water, leave it be
But this is not my dream, sister
It is cold in Heaven
I'm not sprouting wings

I'm drowning me
I'm drowning me, yeah

Brother, can you see those birds?
They don't look to Heaven
But they don't need religion, they can see
They go down to the water
Drink down of the water
Fly up off the water, leave them be
But this is not my time, sister
It is cold in Heaven
And no one's coming after me
I'm drowning me (Breathing ourselves)
I'm drowning me (Breathing ourselves)

You know I am tired
Cold and bony tired
Nothing's gonna save me, I can see
I can't say I'm fearful
I can't say I'm not afraid
But I am not resisting, I can see
Now, I don't need a heaven
And I don't need religion
I am in the place where I should be
I am breathing water
I am breathing water
You know a body's got to breathe

I'm drowning me (Breathing ourselves, breathing ourselves)
I'm drowning me (Breathing ourselves)
I'm drowning me, yeah (Breathing ourselves, breathing ourselves)
I'm drowning me (Breathing ourselves)1Embed
