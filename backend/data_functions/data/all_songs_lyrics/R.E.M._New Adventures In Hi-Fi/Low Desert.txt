Low Desert Lyrics
It happened fast, it's over quick
A little dust, and the engine kicks
Did your hands drift down off the wheel?
Roll out, hit your windshield
An eyelash or a little bit of sleep? Time stands still
Just call it now, and you're on your way

Hey
Hey hey
Hey

All the ashtrays, cities, and the freeway drives
Broken casino and water-slides
Eighteen-wheeler, payback dice
Gravity pulls on the power line
Jet stream cuts the desert sky, this is a land could eat a man alive
Say you'll leave it all behind

Hey
Hey hey
Hey

There's a radio tower that's egging you on
Back to the place where you never belong
Where the people thrive on their own contempt
Whatever meaning is long gone, spent
If you had to guess or make a bet
Would you place yourself inside of it?
The mountains yawn, the clouds let out a sigh
"Tricked again," let go, okay

Hey
Hey hey
Hey
Hey hey
HeyEmbed
