So Fast, So Numb Lyrics
You're moving through rough waters, motel boy
And swimming in your sleep
How could I be so blind, mis-sighted
Not to see there's something wounded deep?
Well, anyone could scratch your surface now
It's all amphetamine
You're blasting yourself into the present
To blur some past indignity, say that

You say that you hate it
You want to recreate it

I've been around, I've been your lover
I let it go at Kill Devil Hill
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel

You're drinking raw adrenal, baby
And do-si-do, saddo
You're eating cartilage, shark eyes, shark heart, all present tense
And boy, your blood is running cold
Listen, this is now, this is here, this is me
This is what I wanted you to see
That was then, was that, that is gone, is passed
You cast yourself, cast passed by, thrown down fast
You say, you say that you hate it
You want to recreate it

I've played this round, I've played your lover
I played it out to the hilt, woah
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel


You love it, you hate it
You want to recreate it
Now, this is here, this is me
This is what I wanted you to see
That was then, was that, that is gone
Is what I wanted you to feel

You love it, you hate it
I'm spitting out the bitter pill, woah

I've been around, I've been your lover
I let it go at Kill Devil Hill
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel, woah
I've played this round, I've played your lover
I played it out to the hilt, woah
You're coming onto something so fast, so numb
That you can't even feel
You've played around, you played me lover
I let it go at Kill Devil Hill, woah
You're moving so hard, so fast, so numb
That you can't even feelEmbed
