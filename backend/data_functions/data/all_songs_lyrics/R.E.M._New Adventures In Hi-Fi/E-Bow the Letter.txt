E-Bow the Letter Lyrics
Look up, what do you see? All of you and all of me
Fluorescent and starry, some of them, they surprise
The bus ride, I went to write this, 4 AM, this letter
Fields of poppies, little pearls, all the boys and all the girls
Sweet-toothed, each and every one a little scary
I said your name, I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars
Hash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras
Dreaming of Maria Callas, whoever she is
This fame thing, I don't get it
I wrap my hand in plastic to try to look through it
Maybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves
It can take you far, this star thing, I don't get it

I'll take you over, there
I'll take you over, there
Aluminum, tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
I'll take you over, there
It tastes like fear
I'll take you over

Will you live to 83?
Will you ever welcome me?
Will you show me something that nobody else has seen?
Smoke it, drink, here comes the flood
Anything to thin the blood
These corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet
Phone, eat it, drink, just another chink
Cuts and dents, they catch the light
Aluminum, the weakest link
I don't wanna disappoint you, I'm not here to anoint you
I would lick your feet, but is that the sickest move?
I wear my own crown of sadness and sorrow
And who'd have thought tomorrow would be so strange?
My loss, and here we go again
I'll take you over, there
I'll take you over, there
Aluminum, tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
I'll take you over, there
It tastes like fear, pulls us near
I'll take you over

Look up, and what do you see?
All of you and all of me, fluorescent and starry
And some of them, they surprise
I can't look it in the eyes, Seconal, Spanish fly, absinthe, kerosene
Cherry-flavored neck and collar
I can smell the sorrow on your breath
The sweat, the victory and sorrow, the smell of fear
I got it

I'll take you over, there
Aluminum, tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
I'll take you over, take you there
Aluminum, tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
I'll take you over, take you there
It tastes like fear, pulls us near
I'll take you over, take you there
It tastes like fear, pulls us near
Pulls us near (It tastes like fear)
It tastes like fear (Pulls us near)
Pulls us near (Near, near)
Over, over, over, over (And nearer and nearer)
Over, over, yeah
Oh, oh (I'll take you over)
Yeah
(I'll take you over, I'll take you there)
Oh, over (I'll take you there)
Over, baby (I'll take you over)
There, there
There, baby1Embed
