Departure Lyrics
Just arrived Singapore, San Sebastian, Spain, 26-hour trip
Salt Lake City, come in spring over the salt flats
A hailstorm brought you back to me
Salt Lake City, come in spring over the salt flats
A hailstorm brought you back to me

Here it comes
I'm carried away
Here it comes
I'm carried away
Here it comes

Departure, godspeed, bless his heart, good Lord
What a fuck-up, what a fighter
A free-fall, motorcycle, hang-glider
Hung on the line like a, a poison spider
Win a eulogy from William Greider
A car crash, ptomaine, disposable lighter
A bus plunge, avalanche, RV, vinegar cider
Free-fall, motorcycle, hang-glider

Here it comes
I'm carried away
Here it comes
I'm carried away
Here it comes, bad, bad
Go, go, go, go, yeah
Go, go, go, go, yeah
There's so much
Go, go, go, yeah

Well, everybody is young forever
There's so much to tell you, so little time
I've come a long way since, uh, whatever
Shit, I still see that word and think of you
But there is so much that I can't do, yeah
There's so much
And you will be young forever
There is so much that I can't do
There is so much that I can't do

Here it comes
I'm carried away
Here it comes
I'm carried away
Here it comes, bad, bad
Here it comes
I'm carried away
Here it comes
I'm carried away
Here it comes, bad, bad1Embed
