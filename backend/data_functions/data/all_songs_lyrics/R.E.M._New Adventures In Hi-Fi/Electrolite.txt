Electrolite Lyrics
Your eyes are burning holes through me
I'm gasoline
I'm burning clean
Twentieth century, go to sleep
You're Plasticine
That is obscene
That is obscene

You are the star tonight
Your sun electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're out of sight

If I ever want to fly
Mulholland Drive
I am alive
Hollywood is under me
I'm Martin Sheen
I'm Steve McQueen
I'm Jimmy Dean

You are the star tonight
Your sun electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're out of sight
If you ever want to fly
Mulholland Drive
Up in the sky
Stand on a cliff, and look down there
Don't be scared
You are alive
You are alive

You are the star tonight
Your sun electric outta sight
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight
Electrolite
You're out of sight

Twentieth century, go to sleep
Really deep
We won't blink
Your eyes are burning holes through me
I'm not scared
I'm out of here
I'm not scared
I'm out of here1Embed
