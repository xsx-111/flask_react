Astralplane Lyrics
Take me away from this awful, evil place
Far from fear, far from grace
Another world, another plane
To call my own, to call my home

Let's lift from ground, from this evil sound
Take a ride with us through time
Places no one ever been before
Let us go through the door

My blood turning cold down to the bone
Lying in the dark, my eyes are closed
On my knees, it's your last chance to make me know
The sky is black as this feeling in my soul

The words of truth sound like lies
They've been feeding on my mind
How you did, you let me down
Now I'm leaving this behind

My blood turning cold down to the bone
Lying in the dark, my eyes are closed
Down on my knees, it's your last chance to make me know
The sky is black like my soul

Reapers walking, casting shadows
Dreams I held fall and shatter
Wind is wailing, sky is falling
He is waiting, death is calling

Take me away from this awful, evil place
Another world, another plane to call my own
Far from fear and far from grace
Take me away from this awful evil place, let me go

Feel my blood turning cold
Lying in the dark my eyes are closed
Down on my knees, it's you last chance to make me know
The sky is black as this feeling in my soulEmbed
