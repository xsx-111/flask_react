Black Smoke Lyrics
Gallons of water was flowing
And people were floating up to the air
Death came up with his black robe on
And took all the sinners to hell

Is there nothin' left to see?
Have we ever been?
Is this all a dream?
Or a haunting in my sleep?

Sixteen demons haunt me in my sleep
Never leaving a moment of peace
Sixteen reasons I'll never know who I am
I just keep wondering
And drifting alone in this life till I'm dying, dying

All of the forests were burnin'
And black smoke was risin' up to the air
God came down with his white beard, long
And damned all the sinners who dared

Is there nothing left to see?
Have we ever been?
Is this all a dream?
Or a haunting in my sleep?
A thousand thoughts going through my mind
Dreams I once had I left behind
I've got an angel knocking at my door
Accept and let go, I wave goodbye to my soul, soul

Sixteen demons haunt me in my sleep
Never leaving a moment of peace
Sixteen reasons I'll never know who I am
I just keep wondering
I just keep wondering2Embed
