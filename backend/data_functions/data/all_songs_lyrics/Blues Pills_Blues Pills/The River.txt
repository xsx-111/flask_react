The River LyricsI go, I go
Walking south by the river
I'm told, I'm told
I'll find gold by the river
So long, so long
My dear friends and hello strangers
So shine, so shine
My sweet metal please release me
Oh my body's sore
Don't hurt no more
It's time, it's time
I hope my search will find an answer
So wash, so wash
Wash that dirt from my treasure
It's hard, it's hard
But I learn and I get better
It's hard, it's hard
But I learn and I get better
I go, I go
But it's a long way to the river
And I wash, I wash
I wash my dirt from my treasure
It's hard, so hard
But I learn and I get better
It's hard, it's hard
But I learn and I get betterEmbed
