Devil Man LyricsOh, devil man
Oh, devil man
You got money in your pocket
You got blackness in your soul
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
You got money in your pocket
You got blackness in your soul
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
You think you've got the answer
Oh, but you could never know
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
You take diamonds you've been given
And you turn them into coal
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
For you ain't got no reason
And your heart's a dirty hole
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Your feeble mind is wicked
You're never gonna learn
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Too late to be forgiven
You got what you deserved
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Hey, there's evil
Evil inside of you growing
Evil, evil inside of you showing
Evil, evil inside of you glowing
Evil, you're such a devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Your feeble mind is wicked
You're never gonna learn
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Too late to be forgiven
Your soul is gonna burn
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil man
Oh, devil manEmbed
