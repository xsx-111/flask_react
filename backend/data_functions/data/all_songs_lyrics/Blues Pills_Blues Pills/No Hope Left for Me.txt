No Hope Left for Me LyricsLonesomeness is killing me
And all my trouble deep inside
With a heavy heart I could no longer stand
A glow of light he made me smile
So he took me to a long lost place
I never ever seen before
With a weakness for his warm embrace
A short time I thought that he would stay
I know you won't be far
I try to let go but you just let me fall
If I could do it I would have changed myself
There's no easy way got nothing left to say
When there is no relief, no hope for me, no signs
Your words keep breaking me, they're only hurtful lies
Pay no mind I wouldn't doubt
That you also felt the same
Turning off my heart and my mind
I wish I never let you in
My bitterness and wobbly soul
No one could ever heal
Still you caught me under your control
With the sick ways you got me to feel
I know you won't be far
I try to let go but you just let me fall
If I could do it I would have changed myself
There's no easy way got nothing left to say
When there is no relief, no hope for me, no signs
Your words keep breaking me, they're only hurtful lies
I know you won't be far
You just let me fall
If I could do it, I would have changed myself
If I could do it, there's no wasy way
When there is no relief, no hope for me, no signs
Your words keep breaking me, they're only hurtful liesEmbed
