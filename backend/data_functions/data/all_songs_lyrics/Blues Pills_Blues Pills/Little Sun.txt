Little Sun Lyrics
When the night is dark and lonely
And you've got no place to go
From your eyes tears are falling
The other side is calling
I'm the one who's left alone
And I still remember when you told me
You would never leave me on my own
Oh, where are the ones I used to know?

The mountain's falling all around me
The deep blue ocean overflows
The ground is shaking underneath me
In this spinning world without control
Oh, though it's hard, little sun
You have to know
When dark comes around
It's when you have to glow

Time is passing by
I just watch it go
But I'll be around
Even though I may not show
It's hard, little sun
You have to know
When dark comes around
It's when you have to glow
Try to understand but I am in a haze
In this sorry world I only see your face

Time passing by
I just watch it go
Don't you know, I need your light?
Don't you know, I need you so?
Darkness comes around
It's when you have to glow
Oh, remember what you said
Oh, the promise that you gave
In the corners of my mind
The darkness hides
Don't you know, I need your light?
Don't you know, I need you so?
Try to understand but I am in a haze
You're not alone, I will always stayEmbed
