Gypsy Lyrics
I head across the country looking for Mexico
I got stuck in Kansas with no place to go
Oh, I'm a gypsy, that's what I am
Ooh, I'm a gypsy and I don't give a damn
Somebody took my load
And I got no place to go
But I'm tryin' to find my mind
Yes, I'm tryin' to find myself

I'm a gypsy, that's what I am
Ooh, I'm a gypsy and I don't give a damn
And I can see a train a-comin' down the track
I'm gonna jump on it and I won't look back
Ho-oh, I can see a train a-comin' down the track
I'm gonna jump on it, and I won't look back

Ain't nobody stop my movin'
Comin' to your, comin' to your town
Time is wastin'
Ain't no time for my world renown
'Cause I can see a train comin' down the track
I can see a train comin' down the track
I'm movin' across the highway over this great land, hey
Comin' to your town to see your face
Time is wastin', ain't no time to waste
I am a gypsy, that's what I amEmbed
