Medio-Core LyricsMedio-core, it's not forsaken
The music they're makin' will leave you with a feeling of indifference
How was the band? They were okay (okay)
Not great (all right), but pretty good
They played the songs I knew they would
Some old, some new
The same formula stays true
We can concur: it's medio-core
Sing, sing a song
Make it simple
So all the kids can sing along (ahh)
Sing along (ahh)
The list keeps growin'
The melodies been stolen
Remind me of songs sung in the 70's
You might fool the kids
But you don't fool me
Have you ever heard of something called
Aboriginality?
Is it absurd
To compose music no one's ever heard
Predictability
Like a bussom will comfort them
My one true foe
L.C.D
(Medio-core) It's upper powered
The riffs are all deflowered
(Medio-core) It's spreading faster
Than British tooth decay
(Medio-core) Are you ready to rock?
How ya'll doing tonight?
(Medio-core) You condescending fucks
Make me wanna laugh and puke at the same time
(Medio-core)
I want to speak
This song sounds like fifteen you've heard before
Medio-core
Sing
Sing a song
Make it simple
So all the kids can sing along (ahh)
Sing along (ahh)Embed
