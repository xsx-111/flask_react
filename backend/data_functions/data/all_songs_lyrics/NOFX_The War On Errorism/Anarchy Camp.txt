Anarchy Camp LyricsGot an invitation to go to Anarchy Camp
There will be twistin', fistin', biting, fighting all in an evening
The soundtrack will go multi platinum
Barbecue a boca while the effigies burn
You may not wanna stay to see how we take care of a turncoat
Christiania's kinda far away
So come along with me
We can dance and trip and be anarchists
We gotta get the manual and put it in the oven till it cooks
We're gonna take the ashes to the wassail and we'll drink
Rules of Anarchy Camp: reckless abandonment
Random acts of dumbness will be rewarded
If you see somebody taking charge, you'll be expected to beat them
Cause everyone who's no one will be participating
No one who is someone will ever get to know the joys of anarchism
Destruction of the system, yeah
So come along with us
Salad days and nights on the anarchaic bus
We're gonna pick up indigents and crusties and a half a dozen nuts
And we're never coming home
Underwater basket-weaving
Methamphetamine symposiums
African killer spelling bees
Bowling in ice hockey rinks
Anarchy Camp's never inert
(You think we don't know that it's)
Not much fun till someone gets hurt
So we're greasing up the rusty vert ramp
Time to make some reservations for next year's Anarchy CampEmbed
