We Got Two Jealous Agains LyricsI thought you were the one when I heard Holidays in the Sun come from your bedroom
But my mind started to stray when I saw Youth of Today mixed with your singles
What's with this Underdog and this GnR EP?
I don't think Hanoi Rocks and I don't want your Paul Stanley next to my Subhumans gatefold
I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I don't think this record merger's gonna work
But when I saw Christ on Parade and This is Boston, Not LA
I knew you were the one
I knew you were for me when I saw the first Vandals EP
I found SNFU and cool, I owned that record too
Seems we both had Social Unrest and sung "she's a pervert nurse"
We both had the first pressing of How Could Hell Be Any Worse
I knew you were the one
So now we got two Earth ADs
We got two Killing Jokes
We got two Adolescents
Two Peni's and two The Crews
We got two Someone Got Their Head Kicked Ins
We got two Declines, two Damageds
And two Jealous Agains
I knew you were the one
When I saw Machine Gun Etiquette
I knew you were the one
When I saw the Peace War comp
We got two Articles of Faith
31 minutes of Group Sex
A couple of Avengers
And a pair of Out Of Steps
We got two What We Do Is Secret
We got two TSOL's
We got two Freedom Of Choices
We got two Three Hits From Hells
I knew you were the one1Embed
