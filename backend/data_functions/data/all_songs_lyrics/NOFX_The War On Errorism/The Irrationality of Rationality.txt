The Irrationality of Rationality LyricsFrank, the new CEO, had to answer to the board
The board was getting anxious and the shareholders
Were on the bed, legs in air, ass cheeks opened wide
They were about to get fucked like it was their first time
When one makes 20 million and 10,000 people lose
What keeps that one from swallowing a shotgun?
Dan, the company man, felt loyalty to the corp
After 16 years of service, and a family to support
He actually started to believe the weaponry and chemicals were for national defense

The guilty don't feel guilty, they learn not to
Helen is living in her car, trying to feed her kids
She got laid off of work and her house was repossessed
It's hard to think clearly when it's 38 degrees
Desperate people have been known to render desperate deeds
But when she shot that family and moved into their home
The paper read she suffered from dementiaEmbed
