The Separation of Church and Skate LyricsHey Kids!
(Hey Dad!)
What do you want to do today?
(We don't know!)
Wanna go to the matinee?
(No!)
Wanna go to the Amusement Park?
(No!)
Wanna go to the punk rock show?
(Yeah! Let's go to the punk rock show!)
Lost in a sea of combat boots
Flush the bouncers with wasted youth
When did punk rock become so safe?
When did the scene become a joke?
The kids who used to live for beer and speed
Now want their fries and coke
Cursing and birds are not allowed
In fact let's keep noise levels down
Must separate the church and skate!
Why don't we put pads on the kids?
Helmets, head gear and mouth pieces!
Then we could pad the floors and walls
Put cameras inside bathroom stalls
We make sure only nice bands play
Make every show a matinee
Teach kids to be all they can be
And we could sing my country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
When did punk rock become so safe?
I know it wasn't Duane or Fletcher
Who put up the barricades
Like a stake in the heart
Somehow we got driven apart
I want conflict! I want dissent!
I want the scene to represent
Our hatred of authority
Our fight against complacency
Stop singing songs 'bout girls and love!
You killed the owl! You freed the dove!
Confrontation and politics
Replaced with harmonies and shticks
When did punk rock become so tame?
These fucking bands all sound the same
We want our fights we want our thugs!
We want our burns we want our drugs!
Where is the violent apathy?!
These fucking records are rated G!
When did punk rock become so safe?!5Embed
