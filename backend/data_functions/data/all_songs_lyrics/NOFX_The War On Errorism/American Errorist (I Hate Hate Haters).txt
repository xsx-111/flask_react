American Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters) LyricsIt's ok, allow yourself a little hate
Hatred is not so bad when directed at injustice
You can turn the other cheek, just don't turn the other way
Enemy of the planet we finally have a common hate
A reason to forget about our differences
And stand as a united front
It's up to us, we must expose
Humiliate American errorists
We'll start with one
The war has just begun
The war has just begun!Embed
