13 Stitches LyricsThe first time I saw The Descendents
They were the fastest band I'd ever seen
No one in the crowd really cared for them
We were waiting for The Alley Cats to play
After a couple months I heard Kabuki Girl
On Rodney on the ROQ late Sunday night
That was enough for me, I hopped the bus
To Licorice Pizza and bought my all time favorite record
The next time I went to The Whisky
It was D.O.A. with Millions of Dead Cops
The latter band played faster than I could believe
But the songs sounded the same and kinda sucked
Said John Wayne was a Nazi
And Joey Shithead was a drunk
Then John Macias beat some hippie to a pulp
Cause having long hair was a mistake
The third time I went to the hospital
I needed 13 stitches in my head
I managed to catch about 6 songs of Ill Repute
Then some suicidal threw me into a post
My girlfriend started to cry cause we had to leave
Before DRI played 50 lousy songs
My blood stained shirt smelled of clove cigarettes
But it sure looked pretty cool after a wash1Embed
