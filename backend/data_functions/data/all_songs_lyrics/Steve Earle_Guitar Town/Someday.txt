Someday Lyrics
There ain't a lot that you can do in this town
You drive down to the lake and then you turn back around
You go to school and you learn to read and write
So you can walk into the county bank and sign away your life

Now I work at the filling station on the interstate
I'm pumping gasoline and counting out-of-state plates
They ask me, "How far into Memphis, son, and where's the nearest beer?"
And they don't even know that there's a town around here

Someday I'm finally going to let go
Because I know there's a better way
And I want to know what's over that rainbow
I'm going to get out of here someday, someday

Now my brother went to college because he played football
But I'm still hanging round 'cause I'm a little bit small
But I got me a '67 Chevy, she's low and sleek and black
Someday I'll put her on that interstate and never look back

Someday I'm finally going to let go
Because I know there's a better way
And I want to know what's over that rainbow
I'm going to get out of here someday, someday
I'm going to get out of here
Someday, someday, somedayEmbed
