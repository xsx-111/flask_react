Guitar Town Lyrics
Hey pretty baby, are you ready for me?
Yeah it's your good rocking daddy down from Tennessee
I'm just out of Austin, bound for San Antone
With the radio blasting and the bird dog on
There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town
But no local yokel gonna shut me down
Because me and my boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town
Nothing ever happened around my hometown
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone calling my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway
Everybody told me you can't get far
On thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rocking little combo from the Guitar Town
Hey pretty baby, don't you know it ain't my fault?
I love to hear the steel belts humming on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wondering why I don't stop
Well I got to keep rocking while I still can
I got a two pack habit and a motel tan
When my boots hit the boards, I'm a brand new man
With my back to the riser, I make my stand
Hey pretty baby, won't you hold me tight?
I'm loading up and rolling out of here tonight
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
And take you back with me to the Guitar TownEmbed
