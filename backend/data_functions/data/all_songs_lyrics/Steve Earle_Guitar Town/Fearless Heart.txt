Fearless Heart Lyrics
Don't you worry about what you've been told
'Cause honey I ain't even close to cold
It's kinda soon to fall in love again
Sometimes the best that you can do is just jump back in

I got me a fearless heart
Strong enough to get you through the scary part
It's been broken many times before
A fearless heart just comes back for more

Folks will tell you that I'm just no good
But I wouldn't hurt you, honey, if I could
Now I can't promise this will work out right
But it'd kill me, darling, if we didn't even try

I got me a fearless heart
Strong enough to get you through the scary part
It's been broken many times before
A fearless heart just comes back for more

I admit I fall in love a lot
I nearly always give it my best shot
I know you must think I'm the reckless kind
Well, I want a lady with a fearless heart just like mine
I got me a fearless heart
Strong enough to get you through the scary part
It's been broken many times before
A fearless heart just comes back for more
I got me a fearless heart
Strong enough to get you through the scary part
It's been broken many times before
A fearless heart just comes back for moreEmbed
