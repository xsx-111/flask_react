State Trooper LyricsNew Jersey Turnpike
Cruisin' on a wet night
Beneath the refinery's glow
Out where the bleak black water flows
License, registration
I ain't got none
But I got a clear conscience
'Bout the things that I done
Mister state trooper
Please don't y'stop me
Please don't y'stop me
Please don't y'stop me
Maybe you got a kid
Maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I got
Has Been both'rin' me my whole life
Mister state trooper
Please don't y'stop me
Please don't y'stop me
Please don't stop me
Now, in the wee, wee hours
Your mind get hazy
Radio relay towers
Won't you lead me to my baby
Now, the radio's jammed up
With talk show stations
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk
'Til you're losin' your patience
Mister state trooper
Please don't y'stop me
Well, please don't y'stop me
Well, please don't stop me
Is anybody out there
Listenin' to my last prayer?
Hi ho, silver-o
Deliver me from nowhereEmbed
