Think It Over Lyrics
You're here, you're gone, I'm still hanging on
This game ain't nothing new
You've changed your mind so many times
I'm still in love with you

I'll think it over when you're walking out the door
Why'd you go and leave me sad and blue?
And if you knew what I go through, you'd think it over too

I hope someday I'll find a way
I'll walk right out on you
Till that day comes, I'm still the one
If you should need a fool

I'll think it over when you're walking out the door
Why'd you go and leave me sad and blue?
And if you knew what I go through, you'd think it over
You'd think it over
You'd think it over tooEmbed
