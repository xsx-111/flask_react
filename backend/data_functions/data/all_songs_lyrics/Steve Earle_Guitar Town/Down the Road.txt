Down the Road LyricsOn the blue side of the evenin'
When the darkness takes control
You start lookin' for a reason
To take your lonesome on down the road
Because the night is filled with strangers
All you need is one you know
If she ain't the one you're after
Keep on lookin' on down the road
Though the miles lay long behind you
You have still got miles to go
How's love ever gonna find you?
If it ain't here, it's down the road
Though the miles lay long behind you
You have still got miles to go
How's love ever gonna find you?
If it ain't here, it's down the road
Keep on lookin' on down the road
On the blue side of the evenin'
When the darkness takes controlEmbed
