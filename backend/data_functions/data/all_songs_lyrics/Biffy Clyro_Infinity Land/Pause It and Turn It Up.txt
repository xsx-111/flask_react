Pause It and Turn It Up LyricsAll I ask of you is to stick around
Express the pain and your sadness
All I ask of you is to turn him down
Confess the system at work here
Wounds take time to heal
Wounds take time to heal
All I ask of you is to stick around
Explain the art of your madness
All I ask is the truth and that you turn him down
Confess the system at work here
Wounds take time to heal
Wounds take time to heal
I have an idea about the voices I hear
They're audible to everyone, everyone but me
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off
Turn it off
I have an idea about the voices I hear
They're audible to everyone, everyone but me
Turn it off
(All I ask is you, all I ask is you)
Turn it off
(All I ask is you, all I ask is you)
Turn it off
(All I ask is you, all I ask is you)
Turn it off
(All I ask is you, all I ask is you)
Turn it off, turn it off
(All I ask is you, all I ask is you)
(I have an idea)
Turn it off, turn it off
(All I ask is you, all I ask is you)
(Abut the voices I hear)
Turn it off, turn it off
(All I ask is you, all I ask is you)
(They're audibe to everyone)
Turn it off, turn it off
(All I ask is you, all I ask is you)
(Everyone but me)
I've been walking in shoes laced with poison
Through a grave of your distractions
Looking over, seems like something is missing
I have burned a hole in your conscience
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean what I said
"I still love you," screams the architect of us
I've tried to tell you with these words that I love you
And I'm sorry
I'm sorryEmbed
