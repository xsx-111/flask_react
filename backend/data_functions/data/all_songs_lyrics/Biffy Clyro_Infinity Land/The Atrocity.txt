The Atrocity LyricsI don't wanna die
Don't expect me to die
I've got my enemies within my sight
We're looking through a stained-glass genocide
I don't wanna die
Don't expect me to die
What's joy without the tears filling our eyes?
Memories of a perfect time
We dream of nothing or so we say
We dream of discovering a perfect trail
To the answers that will seal our pale faces
That can't happen now it's flickering out
Will we meet again? I hope somehow
Even if we pass you on your way out
I don't wanna die
Don't expect me to die
We can live forever
I don't wanna die
Don't expect me to die
We can live foreverEmbed
