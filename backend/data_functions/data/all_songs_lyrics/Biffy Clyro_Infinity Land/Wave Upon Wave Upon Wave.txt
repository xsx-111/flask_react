Wave Upon Wave Upon Wave LyricsWhy bother talking if nobody's listening
Blame it on the final phase of your induction
Why bother talking if nobody's listening
Name it as a firstborn, the firstborn is dead
There's a knife in my hand
Covered in blood, I can't understand
Why, fucker, why
Wave upon wave upon wave upon wave
Why bother sitting, I can't stand sitting
Just blame it on someone, it's your own instruction
Why bother talking if nobody's listening
Name it as a firstborn, the firstborn's alive
There's a knife in my hand
Covered in blood, I can't understand
Why, fucker, why
Why, why, why, why
I've waited so long
I've waited so long
To see what it takes
I can't say no
I can't say no
To see what it takes
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
We're letting it go
Just before time
Sink to the bottom of our lives
We're letting it go
Before our time
Helping us through our sad lives
Do you believe in magic?
Do you believe in magic?
Do you believe in magic?
Do you believe in magic?
Wave upon wave upon wave upon waveEmbed
