Strung to Your Ribcage LyricsYou'll never catch me
My belly is black and red
Black and red
Black and red
Black and red
You complete me
Fucking say it
Fucking say it
Fucking say it
It's like you're meant to be a hostage
Another hostage
Will eat you alive
Fucking say it
Fucking say it
Fucking say it
I take it for granted
That you'll feel at home
You complete me
When you flirt it makes me nauseous
I'm fucking nauseous
And I'll eat you alive
I take it for granted
That you'll feel at home
Emotions never change
Only towards you
Look down, I'm strung to your ribcage
Look down, I'm strung to your ribcage
Inflamed, in every other way
In every other way
Look down, I'm strung to your ribcage
Look down, I'm strung to your ribcage
Inhale the splinters and the rain
The splinters and the rain
Look down, I'm strung to your ribcage
Look down, I'm strung to your ribs
Ooh, oohEmbed
