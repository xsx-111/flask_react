The Weapons Are Concealed LyricsI'm wearing it
I'm wearing it under my face
An expression and an admission of my disgrace
But I'm sure I will make it ok
I will try to give you something better
I'm wearing it today
But I'm sure I will make it ok
I will try to give you something better
You, with the grin on your face
Me, with the bag in its place
I've put a rope round my neck
I'm trying to win your respect
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
Death shares everything I have
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
But I hate the way I
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
Conceal the weapons
Blame it on the staring match between the two of us
Blame it on the staring match between the two of us
The two of usEmbed
