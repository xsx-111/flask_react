Glitter and Trauma LyricsDiamonds, glitter, and trauma
Tears with an unfriendly atmosphere
Will make our night
We'll make tonight
Your potential is under-used
Your skin will break into jigsaw-shaped
Pieces of meat
You fall apart
You can save them all
I believe that you can
Even though
You never listen
You never listen
But you are the human strobe
You are the human strobe
We are like lightning, surrounded
You are the human strobe
Slaughtered moments and useless tales
Encourage others to take the blame
I love you when
You're not around
You can save them all
I believe that you can
Even though
You never listen
You never listen
Let's take aim
You're looking the other way
The right target
She's looking the other way
There's no wreckage
I'll help you to do it right
Tonight, we'll make it ours
You are the human strobe
You are the human strobe
We are like lightning, surrounded
You are the human strobe
Lets take aim
I'll help you to do it right
Tonight we'll make it ours
You are the human strobe
You are the human strobe
We are like lightning, surrounded
You are the human strobe
