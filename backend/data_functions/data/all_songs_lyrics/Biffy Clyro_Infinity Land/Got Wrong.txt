Got Wrong LyricsI'm wrong
I'm wrong
I'm wrong
I don't know, why I take, it out on you
Could you dance
In the black light of my glow
Could you dance
In the white light of the snow
I'm wrong
I'm wrong
I'm wrong
My hair, recedes, from the horns
Could you dance
In the black light of my glow
Could you dance
In the white light of the snow
In other words
It takes what it takes
Got wrong
Got wrong
Got wrong
My hair, recedes, from the horns
In other words
It takes what it takes
In other words
It takes what it takes
In other words
It takes what it takes
To rely, on another one
Its our last chance
To help each otherEmbed
