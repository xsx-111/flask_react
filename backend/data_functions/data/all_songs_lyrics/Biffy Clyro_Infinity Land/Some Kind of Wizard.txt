Some Kind of Wizard LyricsIt's spreading from my lungs
Our lips have come undone
And you say it's nothing
To discuss like eagles
And I'm floating face-down
No sense makes sense to me at all
But your expression says it all
No sense makes sense to me at all
It's spreading to my tongue
Insert your own joke here
Quick, unstitch my eyes
Before they stick together
And you say it's nothing to discuss like eagles
And I'm floating face-down
No sense makes sense to me at all
But your expression says it all
No sense makes sense to me at all
Bet that you said you'd never
But you keep what you hold
The chase is everything
And what I want to say
I'm taking it back, taking it back from your history
The chase is everything
Anyone can see
Release the volume of our history1Embed
