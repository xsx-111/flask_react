The Kids From Kibble and the Fist of Light LyricsArgh! Argh! Argh! Ooh!
Argh! Argh! Argh!
Argh! Argh! Argh! Ooh!
Say nothing's better
(You say nothing's better)
Say nothing's better than the rest
Say hope you're better than the rest
'Cos you talk a good game
(Awoo)
Your sensations are suffering
(Awoo)
I'll make your sensations suffer
Through these long, sadistic highs
And you see the way I collide with you
I hope you see straight
Tonight I'm in a rage
Tonight I'm in a rage
Say nothing's better than the rest
'Cos you talk a good game
(Awoo)
My sensations are suffering
(Awoo)
My sensations are suffering
Through these long, sadistic nights
And you see the way I collide with you
I hope you see straight
Tonight I'm in a rage
Tonight I'm in a rage
Once again
You've missed the point
These strange explosions hit me like a fist of light
These strange explosions hit me like a fist of light
(Do you believe that I care?)Embed
