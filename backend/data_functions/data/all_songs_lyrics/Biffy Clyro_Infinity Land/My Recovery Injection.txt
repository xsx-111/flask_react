My Recovery Injection LyricsI've been waitin' on the overdrive
Slick and polished on the inside
Ruins feeding time
I'll recover in an empty room
In remission from a real mood
Sit down, fuck-up, and wait your turn
Why can't we hide our secret lives?
Why can't we climb this useless height?
You hide your time so well
Small scars of love, and hate, and happiness
You hide your scars so well
I'll recover if you want me to
Dig my way out of my black mood
Wait for the sun to fade
Why can't we hide our useless lives?
You hide your time so well
Small scars of love, and hate, and happiness
You hide your scars so well
You hide your time so well
Small scars of love, and hate, and happiness
You hide your scars so well
And nothing matters anymore
And nothing matters anymore
And nothing matters anymore
And nothing matters anymore
And nothing matters anymore
And nothing matters anymore
(You...) And nothing matters anymore
(Say...) And nothing matters anymore
(Nothing...) And nothing matters anymore
(You...) And nothing matters anymore
(Say...) And nothing matters anymore
(Nothing...) And nothing matters anymoreEmbed
