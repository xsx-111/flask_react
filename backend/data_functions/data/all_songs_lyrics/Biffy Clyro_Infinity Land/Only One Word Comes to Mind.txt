Only One Word Comes to Mind LyricsThis time it's now or never
The ones we are supposed to bow to
In time we all crawl
Believe in
Believe in me
In time we all fall
Through her fingers
It's alright to hide away underneath the ocean
Open up the way
I have to feel right
In time we all saw
Him open up her
These words won't help you
If you're looking for answers
These words won't help you
It's alright to hide away underneath the ocean
Open up the way
I have to feel right
She's what I crave
She's what I crave
She's what I craveEmbed
