Hollywood Lyrics
The fires continued through the night
The kid with a bat face appeared at the window then disappeared into the headlights
I was halfway to the Pacific Coast
I had left you in your longing and your yearning like a ghost
There's little room for wonder now, and little room for wildness too
We crawl into our wounds, I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
I'm gonna buy me a house up in the hills
With a tear-shaped pool and a gun that kills
Cause they say there is a cougar that roams these parts
With a terrible engine of wrath for a heart
That she is white and rare and full of all kinds of harm
And stalks the perimeter all day long
But at night lays trembling in my arms

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my place in the sun
And I'm just waiting now, for peace to come

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And we hide in our wounds and I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
And I know my time will come one day soon
I'm waiting for peace to come
And I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
Oh babe we're on the run, we're on the run, we're on the run
Halfway down the Pacific Coast
Well I left you sleeping like a ghost in your wounds
Darling your dreams are your greatest part
I carry them with me in my heart
Darling your dreams are your greatest part
I carry them with me in my heart
Somewhere, don't know
Now I'm standing on the shore
All the animals roam the beaches
Sea creatures rise out of the sea
And I'm standing on the shore
Everyone begins to run
The kid drops his bucket and spade
And climbs into the sun

Kisa had a baby, but the baby died
Goes to the villagers, says "My baby's sick!"
Villagers shake their heads and say to her
"Better bury your baby in the forest quick"

It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind

Kisa went to the mountain and asked the Buddha
"My baby's sick!" Buddha said, "Don't cry"
"Go to each house and collect a mustard seed
But only from a house where no one's died"
Kisa went to each house in the village
"My baby's getting sicker", poor Kisa cried
But Kisa never collected one mustard seed
Because in every house, someone had died
Kisa sat down in the old village square
She hugged her baby and cried and cried
She said everybody is always losing somebody
Then walked into the forest and buried her child
Everybody's losing someone
Everybody's losing someone
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for peace to come
For peace to come1Embed
