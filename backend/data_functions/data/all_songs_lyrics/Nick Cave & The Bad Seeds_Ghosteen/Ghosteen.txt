Ghosteen Lyrics
This world is beautiful
Held within its stars
I keep it in my heart
The stars are your eyes
I loved them right from the start
A world so beautiful
And I keep it in my heart

A ghosteen dances in my hand
Slowly twirling, twirling all around
A glowing circle in my hand
Dancing, dancing, dancing all around (In my hand)
A ghosteen dances in my hand (In my hand)
Slowly twirling, twirling all around (All around)
A ghosteen dances in my hand (In my hand)
Dancing, dancing, dancing all around (All around)
Here we go

There goes the moonlit man
Got a suitcase in his hand
He's moving on
Down the road
Things tend to fall apart starting with his heart
He kisses you lightly and he leaves
Leaves your sleeping body
Curled and dreaming around your smile, your smile
The three bears watch the TV
They age a lifetime, O' Lord
Mama bear holds the remote
Papa bear, he just floats
And baby bear, he has gone
To the moon in a boat, on a boat

I'm speaking about love now
And how the lights of love go down
You're in the back room washing his clothes
Love's like that, you know, it's like a tidal flow
And the past with its fierce undertow won't ever let us go
Won't ever let you go

If I could move the night I would
And I would turn the world around if I could
There's nothing wrong with loving something
You can't hold in your hand
You're sitting on the edge of the bed
Smoking and shaking your head
Well there's nothing wrong with loving things
That cannot even stand
Well there goes your moony man
With his suitcase in his hand
Well every road is lined with animals
That rise from their blood and walk
Well the moon won't get a wink of sleep
If I stay all night and talk
If I stay all night and talk3Embed
