Ghosteen Speaks Lyrics
I am beside you, I am beside you
I am beside you, I am beside you
Look for me, look for me

I am beside you, look for me
I try to forget to remember that nothing is something
Where something is meant to be

I am beside you, I am beside you
Look for me, look for me

Well I think they've
Well they've gathered here for me
I am within you, you are within me
I am beside you, you are beside me
I think they're singing to be free
I think they're singing to be free
I think my friends have gathered here for me
I think they've gathered here for me
To be beside me
Look for me, look for me
I am beside you, you are beside me
You are beside me, look for meEmbed
