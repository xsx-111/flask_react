Leviathan Lyrics
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
I love my baby and my baby loves me
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
I love my baby and my baby loves me

We talked it round and round again
Then drove the car down to the sea, the sea
We sat in the car park for an hour or two
I love my baby and my baby loves me, loves me

I love my baby and my baby loves me
It's vast and wild and it's deep as the sea, the sea
And as the sun sinks into the water now, now, now
I love my baby and my baby loves me, loves me

(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
I love my baby and my baby loves me
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
I love my baby, my baby loves me
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
I love my baby and my baby loves me
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
I love my baby and my baby loves me
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
I love my baby and my baby loves me
(Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my)
I love my baby and my baby loves meEmbed
