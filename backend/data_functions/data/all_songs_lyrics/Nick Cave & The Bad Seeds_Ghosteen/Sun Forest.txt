Sun Forest Lyrics
I lay in the forest amongst the butterflies and the fireflies
And the burning horses and the flaming trees
As a spiral of children climb up to the sun
Waving goodbye to you and goodbye to me
As the past pulls away and the future begins
I say goodbye to all that as the future rolls in
Like a wave, like a wave
And the past, with its savage undertow, lets go

Come on, everyone, come on, everyone
A spiral of children climbs up to the sun
To the sun, to the sun, and on each golden rung
A spiral of children climbs up to the sun

And a man called Jesus, He promised He would leave us
With a word that would light up the night, oh, the night
But the stars hang from threads and blink off one by one
And it isn't any fun, no, it isn't any fun
To be standing here alone with nowhere to be
With a man mad with grief and on each side a thief
And everybody hanging from a tree, from a tree
And everybody hanging from a tree
Come on, everyone, come on, everyone
A spiral of children climbs up to the sun
To the sun, to the sun, taking everyone
A spiral of children climbs up to the sun

There is nothing more valuable than beauty, they say
There is nothing more valuable than love
And I lie amongst the leaves and the burning trees
And the fields of smoke and the black butterflies
And the screaming horses and your bright green eyes, so beautiful
Ah, your bright green eyes, so beautiful

I am here beside you
Look for me in the sun
I am beside you, I am within
In the sunshine, in the sunEmbed
