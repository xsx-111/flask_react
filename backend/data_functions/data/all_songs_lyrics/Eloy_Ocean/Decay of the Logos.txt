Decay of the Logos LyricsOverbearing secular creature
My worshipped king
King of wisdom and pain
You are the one, the mighty one
Ruling so wise
You're the universal sin
Guardian of justice
Offering help
Favorite victim of your self-made gods
Four-continent-king
Empty shroud
Who runs to the indigents aid
Oh my perfect hero
Ah my mighty friend
You're the prince of principle
Wiping out disobedience with your might
Autocratic might
You don't stand for backtalk
So you root it all out by your weapon's light
The atomar light
You are born into your violence
And you live against superior truth
You are born to live the ignorance
And you're proud to kill your spiritual youth
From the upper sea of the setting sun
You submit all mankind to toe the line
You commit your frightful arms
Against the palaces and treasures of our mind
That's why you should remember
The duty that's required by your life
Or is it true that you did surrender
Your only possibility to survive
In taper indented triangles
Sterilized drops of blood
Are wildly raving along and their shadows
They are crossing my horizon
Concrete becomes liquid, sweats along
And pours along through my legs - Alright!
Extensive feverish stuff
Rough surface - murderous red!
Even in the air
Which is still guiding quiet, quiet and understandable
I feel the slippery, whispering
Rainy dead end street
Hanging deep above the vaporing sea
The final signal for low truth approaches
Fear did die
Vanity - insanity, warm, hot and true
Who cut the enemy down? We are betrayed
That's why you should remember
The duty that's required by your life
By our life
Or is it true that you did surrender
Our possibility to survive
You play with all our lifeEmbed
