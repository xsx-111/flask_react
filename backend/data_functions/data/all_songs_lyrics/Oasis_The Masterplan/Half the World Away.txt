Half the World Away Lyrics
Yeah, we're on, haha

I would like to leave this city
This old town don't smell too pretty and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind
And when I leave this island
I'll book myself into a soul asylum
'Cause I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

So here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away

Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down
And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind
And if I could leave this spirit
I'll find me a hole and I'll live in it and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

Here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away

Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down

No, I don't feel down
No, I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
Don't feel down
I don't feel down5Embed
