Stay Young Lyrics
One way out is all you're ever going to get
From those who'll hand them out don't never let it upset you
'Cause they'll put words into your mouths they're making you feel so ashamed
Making you taking the blame
Making you cold in the night
Making you question your heart and your soul
And I think that it's not quite right

Hey! Stay young and invincible
'Cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'Cause we know just what we are
Yeah, we know just what we are
Yeah, we know just what we are

Feed your head with all the things you need
When you're hungry
Stay in bed and sleep all day as long as it's Sunday
'Cause they'll put words into my mouth they're making
Me feel so ashamed
Making me taking the blame
Making me cold in the night
Making me question my heart and my soul
And I think that it's not quite right
Hey! Stay young and invincible
'Cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'Cause we know just what we are
Yeah, we know just what we are
Yeah, we know just what we are
(C'mon!)

Hey! Stay young and invincible
'Cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'Cause we know just what we are
Hey! Stay young and invincible
'Cause we know just what we are
And come what may my faith's unshakable
'Cause we know just what we are
'Cause we know just what we are
'Cause we know just what we are
'Cause we know just what we are
'Cause we know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we are2Embed
