Going Nowhere Lyrics
I hate the way that you've taken back
Everything you've given to me
And the way that you'd always say
It's nothing to do with me
Different versions of many men
Come before you came
All their questions were similar
The answers just the same

I'm gonna get me a motor car
Maybe a Jaguar
Maybe a plane or a day of fame
I'm gonna be a millionaire
So can you take me there
Wanna be wild 'cause my life's so tame
(Here am I) Going nowhere on a train
(Here am I) Growing older in the rain

Hey'ey
Hey'ey
Hey'ey

I hate the way that you've taken back
Everything you've given to me
And the way that you'd always say
It's nothing to do with me
Different versions of many men
Come before you came
All their questions were similar
The answers just the same
I'm gonna get me a motor car
Maybe a Jaguar
Maybe a plane or a day of fame
I'm gonna be a millionaire
So can you take me there
Wanna be wild 'cause my life's so tame
(Here am I) Going nowhere on a train
(Here am I) Growing older in the rain
(Here am I) Going nowhere on a train
(Here am I) Gettin' lost and lonely
Sad and only
Why sometimes
Does my life feel so tame?

Hey'ey
Hey'ey
