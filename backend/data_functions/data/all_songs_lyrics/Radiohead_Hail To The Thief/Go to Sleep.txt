Go to Sleep Lyrics
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down

May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me15Embed
