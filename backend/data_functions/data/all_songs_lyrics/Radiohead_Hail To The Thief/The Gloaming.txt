The Gloaming Lyrics
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out of the bottle
Funny, ha-ha, funny how

When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
With your breathing

They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing

They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
This is the gloaming8Embed
