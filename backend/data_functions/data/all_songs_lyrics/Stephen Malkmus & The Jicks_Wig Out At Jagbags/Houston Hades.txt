Houston Hades Lyrics
I could see you falling in love
Every day people need love
With all their better halves, do the math
Everybody needs it long enough to let it go
If Houston's Hades for Houston ladies
With all those truck huggers, gun luggers
Now you gotta have their babies--No!

This town is so impressive from a distance
Listen, boy, I'm talkin' to you

Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo

Blessed with Noblesse Oblige
She's your queen most of the days
As for the other ones, it's no fun to harp on it--
Everybody's got their days
If love is Hades for all you Slim Shadys
It's no wonder he smashes guitars
Turn the stage into a cool crime scene

It sounds so impressive from a distance
Take it up a notch or two

Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo


Turn it away, turn it away, turn it away, hey
Turn it away, turn it away, turn it away, hey
Turn it away, turn it away, turn away 'cause it falls apart
Turn it away, turn it away, turn it away, hey
Turn it away, turn it away, turn it away, hey
Turn it away, turn it away, turn away 'cause it falls apartEmbed
