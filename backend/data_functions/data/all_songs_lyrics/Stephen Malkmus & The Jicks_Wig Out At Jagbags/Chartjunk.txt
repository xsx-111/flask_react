Chartjunk Lyrics
I've been you
I've been everywhere you're going
Know all that you're knowing
(Boy, I'm gonna make you mine)
That might be true
But I don't need your windbag wisdom
And all the restriction
In one ear and out of the other
If you feel the urge to share
Think again 'cause you're not my mother
Actually, I'm not contractually obliged to care

Dropping dimes
Laying sweet feeds on my homies
No one can slow me down
(Boy, I'm gonna make you mine)
Dipsy-doo
I won't use the glass now
Baby, when I drive around and seize a little time
While you work out your schemes in D-League Wichita
If you flood the lane on me, brother
Watch out for my step-back three
I put the "I" in team like no other
Actually, I'm not contractually obliged to share
Buddy, you're just connected bones
So lose that, lose that, lose that telephone
And call
Us allEmbed
