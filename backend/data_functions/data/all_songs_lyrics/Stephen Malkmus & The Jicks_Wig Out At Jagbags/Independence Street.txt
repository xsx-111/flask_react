Independence Street Lyrics
I don't have the stomach for your brandy
I can hardly sip your tea
I don't have the teeth left for your candy
I'm just busy bein' free
Livin' in this yurt everybody hurts
There's no central heat on Independence Street

I know that she's nothin' but nothin'
Nothin' but a lover girl
See the way she gives away those kisses
She's everything you need and more
Suckin' on a Cert, that ain't no dessert
I cannot compete on Independence Street


I don't have the stomach for your brandy
I can hardly sip your tea
I don't have no teeth left for your candy
I'm just busy bein' me
Riffin' in this church, I just might convert
There's no way to leave from Independence StreetEmbed
