Shibboleth Lyrics
Authority from the Christian constructs
Suffused creativity with guilt
Without which we cannot curb our instincts to abominate it all
With a chop to the Adam's apple
Commemorate your soul

Right angles, triangles, no forgiveness
Ironic, Byronic, post-mod gloom
Get your guard on

Son of the Lord as symbolic death drive
Suffered and died so that we can give
Dud ammunition so you can criticize and eulogize it all
I'm a connoisseur of scrapple
Alone as someone else

Right angles, triangles, no forgiveness
Ironic, Byronic, post-mod gloom
Get your guard onEmbed
