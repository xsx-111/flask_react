J Smoov Lyrics
I can't afford to want you
Still, I can't avoid your play
You creep into my organization
A whistle to the wolves at bay

At this point, darling, I must say
That the seeds unsown gonna grow anyway
Rent a room, get it over with

In a race to the inside of your face
You're afraid of me
Shuffling for Xanadu
Jewels, a magnet
The solitary dragnet
Looking for all I know


Well, I see you're afraid of me
Doing the jest I do
Speak of arrangements, baby
But you haven't got a clue
For all that I do, I know
End of the seesaw
End of the seesaw
End of the seesaw
End of the seesaw
End of the seesawEmbed
