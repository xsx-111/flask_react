Scattegories Lyrics
Scattegories categories
Scum electrocrats
Automatic roar
Party crash with Balderdash
Arms of Mickey's Big
Gets 'em every time
Memory escapes aplasia

Pictionary Nixon Kerry
Condoleezza's rice
Scattered on the floor
Mott the Hoople's got no scruples
With those groupie Janes
Mascara and Rye
Tempers will be flaring soonEmbed
