Lariat Lyrics
Only a chariot could carry it across this void
I wouldn't jerry rig or candy coat your Latin kisses

You're not what you aren't
You aren't what you're not
You got what you want, you want what you got
People look great when they shave
Don't they?

We lived on Tennyson and venison and The Grateful Dead
It was Mudhoney summer, Torch of Mystics, Double bummer

You're not what you aren't
You aren't what you're not
You got what you want, you want what you got
Feels so great in the shade

A love like oxygen, so foxy then so terrific now
On a jape I'm returning
Bobby spinning out
I was so messed up
You were drunk and high
Just a rambling wreck
Coming off the breaks to see what was shaking
We grew up listening to the music from the best decade ever
Talking about the A-D-D's
We grew up listening to the music from the best decade ever6Embed
