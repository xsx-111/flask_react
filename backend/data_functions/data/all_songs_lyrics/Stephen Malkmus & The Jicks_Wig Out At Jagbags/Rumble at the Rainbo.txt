Rumble at the Rainbo Lyrics
This one's for you, granddad!

Come and join us in this punk rock tomb
Come slam dancing with some ancient dudes
We are returning, returning to our roots
No new material, just cowboy boots (whoa-oh)

Can you remember the thrill and the rush
You're not out of touch
Come tonight, you'll see (Come see)
No one here has changed and no one ever will

We're generation punks are we
The Johnny Thunder-worshipping
Here in the valley, it's funny or it's tough
No emo posing or that straight edge fluff

Can you remember the thrill and the rush
You're not out of touch
Come tonight, you'll see (Come see)
No one here has changed and no one ever
No one here has changed and no one ever
No one here has changed and no one ever
No one here has changed and no one ever will
