Planetary Motion Lyrics
Planetary motion
Circle 'round the sun
United devotion
Through the chosen one
Yellow  see/sea ( stop caught in motion)
To say whenever

Solitary ocean
Clean but never pure
I've got no more lotion
To the art of me
The waves are crashing in ( stop caught in notion)
To sing forever
All the time


Planetary motion
Circle 'round the sun
United devotion
Through the chosen one
Yellow do see ( stop caught in motion)
Will play forever me in the air 
But what a scene (Backstop caught in motion)
We'll play forever
All the timeEmbed
