Surreal Teenagers Lyrics
Reverse creation
Creation in reverse
Elevation is so high
Jello will not harden
Frontier equations
The bestiary rush
Carefree high
Anxious lows
I'm so there
Anorack
Tesseract
Afternoon of a Faun
The mock execution is takin' too long
Well watch the prison run into a train
In my head

Peace be unto you
No military rush
Intellectual oligarch
Make the music listen
Consult the stud file
And warm up the Jag
I need cold fruit in the morning
Custard wax
Marble arch
Victim march
Isokon
Penguin pool
You're so inventive
The way that you drool
Buttons  I change the 
In the red

I've got a carbon copy of you
We've seen your carbon blank
And it's duly noted
That you can't wear black
If you choose to copulate
You better get home fast
With Judy and Gina
The microscopic world

Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers-agers
Let's reconnoiter in St. Mauritz
Near the widow's peak
The raclette is so splendid
Though Astor money's steep
I'd like to move to Micronesia
With my man-servant John
John is ever so loyal
He's pugnacious in that regard

Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers
Surreal teenagers-agers
