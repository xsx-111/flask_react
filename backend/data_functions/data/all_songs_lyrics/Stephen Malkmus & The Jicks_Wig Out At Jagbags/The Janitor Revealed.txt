The Janitor Revealed Lyrics
I was up for just about anything
Lean and hungry, ready to spring
And soon enough you know the time will come
We were put on this Earth to shine
Destined for greatness by design

The mental speed bumps you must navigate
The frigid shoulders interrupting fate
I often jump-cut to my future days
Palpable wealth is on display
The casual confidence to say

In a constant tizzy
Cyber right, I'm busy
Won't you open up the door?
Space cat villain
Try to stop killin'
Me with kindness
My day blindness speak
Searchin' for the era to come

As the glory years shuffle on by
Will the inevitable ever arrive?
You're slow and steady
But you won't win the race
Pardon me while I jump the queue
I got much better things to do
In a constant tizzy
Cyber right, I'm busy
Won't you open up the door?
Space cat villain
Try to stop killin'
Me with kindness
My day blindness speak
Searchin' for the era to comeEmbed
