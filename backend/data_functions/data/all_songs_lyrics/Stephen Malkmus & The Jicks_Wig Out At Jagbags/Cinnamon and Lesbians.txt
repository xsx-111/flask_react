Cinnamon and Lesbians LyricsShanghaied in Oregon
Cinnamon and lesbians
The power lines revolt in time
I've been tripping my face off since breakfast
Taking in this windswept afternoon
Onward ye Christian sailors
You smooth-talking jack-off jailors
A one-stop shop with such narrow convenience
Life should be free
Take what you need
Raised in the numbers trailer
With glass-blowing funky neighbors
Come downtown 'cause we've got a cure for your headlice
We'll do it for free
Love it or leave3Embed
