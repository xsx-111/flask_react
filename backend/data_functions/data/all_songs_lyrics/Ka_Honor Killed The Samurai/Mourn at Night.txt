Mourn at Night Lyrics
To die when it is right to die, to strike when to strike is right

We mourn the night
We mourn the night

What they render is tender, the bars bore me
Young and rich, become amiss by your sob story
My scars last, felt Allah's wrath, God's glory
Path a bridge after I lived the hard forty 'cause

Heat gone, we mourn the night
Heat gone, we mourn the night

No one's mixing words, vicious verbs emerge from being this disturbed
As a kid observed on curbs where they twist the herb
Was wrapping the present years before the gift was heard
My quarters wasn't in calm waters the ships perturbed
I grace on balconies burn, with cowardice shots
Without haste learned alchemy, turn powder to rocks
Kept cautious speech, short and sweet, by my long bitter
Wasn't shook though, I took bow, and a strong quiver
Since elfish, wasn't selfish, a born giver
Until I get my slice, suffice with a formed slither
Spoke with Moors, know the laws, and walk with assurance
I commence with strength, now I'm talkin' endurance
Felt a gleam, too much self-esteem to be a groveler
Been leader since toddler, teachin' not to be a follower
Them days raised my sister rigid, never coddled her
I ain't poppin' shit, just got her doctorate, I'm proud of her
There may be days I lead the way as a beacon
Attractin' by my actions, not my speakin'
My battle plan was grab the hand, I was reachin'
From teens was taught to lean for support was leechin'
So I stood on mine, during the hoodest time
Was a nightmare, felt like life here was as good as dying
We was born in the thorns, few arose
Once a town's noose, now in soundproofs pursuing golds
On the block with the rock up nights dribblin'
Time spent gettin' bent, hard to be upright citizen
It's more than trouble is, same corners are bubblin'
The pawns are huddlin' and all of a sudden it's
Heat gone, we mourn the night
Heat gone, we mourn the night
Heat gone, we mourn the night
Heat gone, we mourn the night

Loss of a fight means loss of life to a samurai

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you really think I want my loved ones gone
Is that any way for a man to carry on
Heat gone, we mourn the night
Heat gone, we mourn the night
