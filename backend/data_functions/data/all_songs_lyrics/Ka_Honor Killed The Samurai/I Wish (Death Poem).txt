I Wish (Death Poem) Lyrics
I wish we ain't have to live like this
I wish we ain't have to live like this
I wish

Wish for a new life when I blew out them candles
Was in them cruel nights, knew I was about to scramble
A little crook to get em hooked, threw out a sample
Five soldiers against high rollers, the crew out to gamble
If them crackas'll blitz and catch the package I pitch
You could quote me, it won't be a slap on the wrist
But that's the risk when you wish to rack in the bricks
And you getting it for whipping the caps and the zips
Flexin 'em ounces destined to stretch to the mountains
Defenders not represented by the best of the counselors
All in one stack from jump packs hastily diminish
Runnin' lower done with before the case even finished
But I swear I ain't hear a word of this
Wheeling and dealing, feeling impervious
When it's steady sling fuck everything is the mantra
I never said a thing, just let it ring through contra
I nest hate, hold heat so weak in my best shape
You press fate, press late - it's your death date
Get down for the crown, even if it got thorns
Fights are final when might is primal we lock horns
Won't dupe the block you shoot to stop no shots warned
Never slack cause attack first time we spot yawns
Rah! That's the infantry symphony
For revenue we're telling you, this ain't how it's meant to be
You and your peers prime years ignored your call
Grindin' gears, for cheers here tryin' to score for more
Can't see certain of the peace, became lord of war
Holy controller was rolling in the corridor
If anything move through, who you? Fuck you want?
Aggressive but finesse is how to pull a tougher stunt
The high is getting money money, never had to puff a blunt
For the record it's saw as checkers, you get huffed the jump
Tryna kick-start when blitz hard, rush the pump
Pack heat, too big for the backseat, bust the trunk
And if men caught they taught to hush for monks
Never know me to fear, only veneers is the custom fronts
I wish we ain't have to live like this
I wish we ain't have to live like this

Nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle, he remains cool. In the midst of catastrophes, he keeps level his mind.  We admire him as truly great, who in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession.  Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death. These were known as samurai3Embed
