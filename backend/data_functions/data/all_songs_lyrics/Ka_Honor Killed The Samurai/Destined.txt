Destined Lyrics
Wasn't made for frontin'
To bring the gauge was nuttin'
Static start, I had the heart to squeeze
Took less than nothing to pull it
My first lesson was never bluff with a bullet
If you show it gotta blow it, spark and leave
Destined
Destined

Hard to take high road when down in the gutter
Stop the flow, I pop and go with the pound and the cutter
Rule the streets faceless, dodgin' police bracelets
Draw weapons before jettin', the shells don't leave traces
Had the trigger right by the abs and liver
Young'ns can find some of my guns, they drag the river
Maximal skill though it may appear minimal
Surprised by my career, thought I'd be career criminal
Hood thieves keep me lifeless, extra part of the strangle
Should be dead from palmin', I work harder than my guardian angel
If you invoke threats for prestige, don't fess
Want to juice or got loose, fresh-squeezed cold-pressed
Get that out of breath phone call, my instincts loading the clips
Fights against us is one sided the livest Mobius strip
Badge of honor was rollin' dipped, bullet holes in the whip
Cops never told me freeze 'cause this as cold as it get
Wasn't made for frontin'
To bring the gauge was nuttin'
Static start, I had the heart to squeeze
Took less than nothing to pull it
My first lesson was never bluff with a bullet
If you show it gotta blow it, spark and leave
Destined
Destined

Missing hope before rhymin', windin' down vicious slope
To feel if you diss a quote you a misanthrope
Cause all that witness hear fitness and richer spoke
You giving the gift of note, pray the wicked croak
The sound rules from drogas's crown jewel
Only judgment is that I love it, never found cruel
Might be wordy and drone but worthy the throne
Seen bring 'em clean kingdom from the dirtiest home
Amongst the dark vermin, while the hearts yearnin'
Too tense to pay attention in class, it was hard learnin'
Don't discard what I carve, I don't whittle nothing little
All my niggas pump for big chunks, fuck the kibble
So to honor their memory, I charm the assembly
And be a lie, hold design with his arm and his remedy
Wasn't made for frontin'
To bring the gauge was nuttin'
Static start, I had the heart to squeeze
Took less than nothing to pull it
My first lesson was never bluff with a bullet
If you show it gotta blow it, spark and leave
Destined
