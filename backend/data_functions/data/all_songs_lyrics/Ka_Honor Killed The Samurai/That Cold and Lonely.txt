That Cold and Lonely Lyrics
Not infrequently a marching soldier might be seen to halt, take his writing utensils from his belt, and compose an ode

This what it look like
This what it look like

Fact you hear me, I’m clearly a modern marvel
Graciously platin’ offerings, they try and starve you
I bathe replenish from my days of menace
Was true by my influence, the rage is in us
I dealt vicious for well-wishers and naysayers
It’s love, they got me from scrub to great player
Guess I was destined, my progression is evident
Want the best, so it test ‘til I rest in the sediment
Was steady pride, try to show you every side
I give it life, but write like I already died
No petty fray, every day I hail the truth
Let it spray, never say Ka failed the youth
I rep with the gods, got the weap's and the scars
Where it ain’t workin’ out 'til you flexin’ in cars
When putting on a mask wasn’t protection from SARS
Drama pacin’ for denomination, 'pressive and large
Crooked in the town with a crew of raw people
That’ll put you in the ground for the root of all evil
Kill in the building, the proof is in the bricks
We revel in the present like the future don’t exist
That's what mold me, that cold and lonely
Where they call you out if they know you phony
I’m live, it’s what it look like
It’s what it look like
It’s what it look like

A phonetical verse praise good
But my genetic code vs. neighborhood
With no clear winner, I still appear thinner
Don’t howl like I’m holier than thou, a mere sinner
Wasn’t blessed to be restin’ in the burbs
I was stressin’, wrestling with the scourge
Stay low in beef, never live high on the hog
If not for Fresh Air Fund, I’da died in the smog
When huntin’ is nothin’ we ain’t tryna rob
Put pressure on the jester, applying it hard
When you step protect your mind and chestplate
Tried years for these ideas to gestate
Progress movin’ to the next, the rest wait
But in this realm am I at the helm or it’s just fate
If you inclined to drop the needle, you’ll find Ka cerebral
They paged - get you caged, I’m trying to free you

This what mold me, that cold and lonely
Where they ring your bell if they know you phony
I’m live, it’s what it look like
It’s what it look like
It’s what it look like
I ain’t scared to die, that’s what it look like
This what it look like
It’s what it look like
Yea, this what it look like
I’m live, this what it look like
