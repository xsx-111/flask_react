Ours Lyrics
These seconds, these minutes right here
You know who they belong to?
Us
That's why they call 'em ours

It took sacrifice, much loss before the gain
Paid a drastic price, misfortune and disdain
Framed a shattered life, the forfeits and the pain
All the saddest sights, the coffins and the stains
On days wish I could save the children that we was
We didn't spare they eyes from all the killings and the drugs
Steppin' and protectin' them from feelin' any slugs
Many ways mediate, the savior healin' any grudge
'Cause in and out the lab bouts was bad, so habits grew
The steel cold, you don't grow real old actin' new
And you can count from all my accounts, the stats is true
To think some was tickled pink when we was beat black and blue
A knave to say we show it sympathy cause I know essentially
All the dastard actions that was happenin', I was meant to see
Dug a lot of work when I was broke and inoperative
Felt a lot of hurt before I spoke this provocative
Heart was ice for that cream tryin' to scoop money
Now breathe for seeds, whether you throw dirt or root for me
These seconds, these minutes are ours
These seconds, these minutes are ours
These seconds, these minutes are ours
These seconds, these minutes are ours

They ours
So do what you gotta do man, cause you dont get no more
A finite number
Gotta seize every, every moment

From crooked boy to honest man, the latter's gone
I speak promised land, the common plan - Babylon
My thwarted thoughts faced for years probably ran marathon
I care to say, if I ever sail away, the plan's Avalon
I vent for all the days I spent positioned in the basement
Feel I had to heal myself, physician and the patient
Was urged home for all the wrong, my riff with immigration
I boast to learn my culture 'fore I picked assimilation
The dose of lies, up close you'll find raps they wisen
At most they rhyme to gross, mine's appetizing
Peep the god though, I speak a hard flow of argot
To steal for meal but for real, I used to starve though
The routes I scored I doubt the Lord ever condone
Steps was reckless, reppin' for precious metals and stone
But now knowledge power, this assemblance evidence shown
Walk with ghosts of close family and friends, I'm never alone
These seconds, these minutes are ours
These seconds, these minutes are ours
These seconds, these minutes are ours
These seconds, these minutes are ours

So accept this - not for its intrinsic value, but as a token

These hours are ours
Make a better place
Mines, yours
It's our time
This that good shit, the fly shit, the real shit
Build, fuck all that destroyin', let's liveEmbed
