Fire Escape Lyrics
Hey Dark Eyes
Rest with me a while as I drift closer to sleep
But still cannot
Still cannot find no peace

And you let go of glass at our feet
It rained through the night
And you, take the fire escape
Run down the street to the church

Hey Murderer
Killin' keeps us close enough
Hey Murderer
Every breath you steal is a breath that I breathe for

You let go of glass at our feet
It rained through the night
And you, take the fire escape
Run down the street to the church
And you let go of glass at our feet
It rained through the night
And you, take the fire escape
Run down the street to the church3Embed
