Full Circle Lyrics
Cap off, kneeling at the back of the church
Feeling water on your brow; if it's healing it hurts
At first a sharpish pain that returns as a thought
That the needle in your skin will bring you closer to God

And I watch as your head turns full circle

All hopeless with old coffee and a medical text
It's too easy knowing nothing, blowing off the rest
And the riddles in the pages leave it too much to guess
And the worry cracks a fracture from your hip to your chest

As I watch as your head turns full circle

You got lost in your travels and a spiritual book
Mistook beaches for nirvana in the way that they look
And the crooks that run the island are killing to keep earning
They're burning seven tonnes of plastic and it seems to be working
Is that the best that I can do?

So watch as your head turns full circle
You appear even-tempered, though your looks will deceive
And the sparks are always flying 'cause you drink for relief
With the heart of a child and the wit of a fool
It's a wonder why I don't try to build a wall around you

And I watch as your head turns full circle


Yeah, I watch as your head turns full circle
Yeah, I watch as your head turns full circle16Embed
