Nerve LyricsThere's a lot of nothing in the words, I know
But I keep on talking cause it feels like home
Feels all right to be growing old
But growing old is just letting go
And it's just the reason I needed to leave this place
I took the whole morning to run away
I had a different image on my mind
It's just it changes always, all the time
And it comes as no surprise it's like
And I just don't know what you're doing wrong yeah, wrong
Man you've got a lot of nerve
And I just don't know what you're doing wrong yeah, wrong
Man you've got a lot of nerve
How come all my vices always breed relief
But a sip of gin saves an hour of speech?
And yeah it's fickle and it feels so cheap
But I can rest and I can feel it eases
It's my friends don't know the half they're just listening
I'm at a loss cause I'm living it
It's not to say that I'm giving in
It's just that this is how it's always been
And it comes as no surprise it's like
And I just don't know what you're doing wrong yeah, wrong
Man you've got a lot of nerve
And I just don't know what you're doing wrong yeah, wrong
Man you've got a lot of nerve
I can't melt all of my worries to nothing
And I would
And I keep trying but I always get let down
Somehow
Man you've got a lot of nerve3Embed
