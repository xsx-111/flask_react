Nothing As It Seems Lyrics
Don't feel like home, he's a little out
And all these words alone is nothing like your poem
Putting in and putting in don't feel like methadone
A scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone

It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

One uninvited chromosome, a blanket like the ozone

It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs
It's home
The little that he frees
Is nothing he believes

Saving up a sunny day
Something maybe two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding? Rainy day
A one way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown
Whisper through a megaphone
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

And all that he frees
A little bittersweet
It's home
It's nothing as it seems
The little that you see
It's home3Embed
