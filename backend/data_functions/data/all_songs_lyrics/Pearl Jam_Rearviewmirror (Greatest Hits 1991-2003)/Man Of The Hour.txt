Man Of The Hour Lyrics
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness
Crashed and on their way
Father he enjoyed collisions; others walked away
A snowflake falls in may
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out

Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now

Nature has its own religion; gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend
And the sky breaks at dawn; shedding light upon this town
They'll all come around

Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now

And the road
The old man paved
The broken seams along the way
The rusted signs, left just for me
He was guiding me, love, his own way
Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
As the curtain comes down
I feel that this is just g'bye for now6Embed
