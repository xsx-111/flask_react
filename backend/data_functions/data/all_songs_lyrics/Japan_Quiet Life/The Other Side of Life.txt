The Other Side of Life Lyrics
Well, it's been a long time
How should I feel? What can I say?
With fantastic stories
You present yourself in different ways

Some particular places
Remembered so well
Are hard to forget
We've travelled so far now
Then we were young
Hard to impress

But she comes and goes
The other side of life
Sheltering only
The other side of life

These single occasions
We seem to share
Stumble and fall
If you could remember to wave
A sign of life my way
But she comes and goes
The other side of life
Sheltering only
The other side of lifeEmbed
