Quiet Life Lyrics
Boys, now the times are changing, the going could get rough
Boys, would that ever cross your mind?
Boys, are you contemplating moving out somewhere?
Boys, will you ever find the time?

Here we are stranded
Somehow it seems the same beware
Here comes the quiet life again

Boys, now the country's only miles away from here
Boys, do you recognize the signs?
Boys, when these driving hands push against the tracks
Boys, it's too late to wonder why

Here we are stranded
Somehow it seems the same beware
Here comes the quiet life again

Now as you turn to leave, never looking back
Will you think of me?
If you ever, could it ever stop?
Oh, the quiet life
Oh, the quiet life
Here we are stranded
Somehow it seems the same beware
Here comes the quiet life again2Embed
