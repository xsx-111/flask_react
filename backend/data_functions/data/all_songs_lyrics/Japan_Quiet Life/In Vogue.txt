In Vogue Lyrics
Before the light of day reveals itself
I am assured she won't forget
But still I will console myself
Should I lose something I could regret?

But now she turns to leave
Exactly like she used to do
Did nobody warn you, boy?
Love's in vogue again, my love
Did nobody tell you, girl?
Love's in vogue again, my love

Before the light of day I awake
She's clearly not herself today
Across a crowded room life begins
Before the moment drifts away
How bitter the morning feels
Exactly like it ought to do

But now she turns to leave
Exactly like she used to do
Did nobody warn you, boy?
Love's in vogue again, my love
Did nobody tell you, girl?
Love's in vogue again, my loveEmbed
