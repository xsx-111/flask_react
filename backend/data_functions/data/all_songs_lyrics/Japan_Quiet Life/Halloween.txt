Halloween Lyrics
The cottage is windswept
Now there's only sorrow here
Follow evacuation signs
You're detached and broken
And so sentimental now
Remembering how we passed our time

(Oh, oh)
Somebody waits for me
(Oh, oh)
Far beyond our Halloween

Germanic forces marching on concrete squares
Our love is just defenseless sound
And could we believe that all you said was true
We would be so determined now

(Oh, oh)
Somebody waits for me
(Oh, oh)
Far beyond our Halloween
Slowly emerging, dividing Germany
Everyone's lost in East Berlin
And only believing just what you want to here
We're waiting at stations once againEmbed
