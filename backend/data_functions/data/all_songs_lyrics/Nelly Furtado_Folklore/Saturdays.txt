Saturdays Lyrics
Hot motel
Stuffy inside
I know well
These eleven walls
Hot black tar
I tan my legs
I rest my heart
And dream of the city

Magazine
And diet coke
I'm not a joke
This is me
Damaged leg
Heavy cart
Plastic cups
Linen mart

Rock garden
Where I used to play
People stare
Part of their day
Coffee break
Lunch at noon
Pumpernickel steak
Green and orange room
Done my list (done my list)
Make my way (make my way)
To help my mother (help my mother)
End her day (end her day)
Fresh cut grass (fresh cut grass)
Parking lot (parking lot)
We roll on out (roll on out)
We got a lot (got a lot)

We're on our way (on our way)
Roll the window down (window down)
And scream out loud (scream out loud)
Oh we're tired now

Take it home (take it hoe)
Step off the way (on my way)
To the bakery (bakery)
For some fruit and cake (fruit and cake)
And home I lay (home I lay)
After a shower clean (shower clean)
I hit my head (hit my head)
And I dreamEmbed
