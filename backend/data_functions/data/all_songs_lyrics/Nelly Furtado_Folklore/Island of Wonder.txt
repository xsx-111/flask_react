Island of Wonder Lyrics
The man wrinkles his face
But it's already worn
The coffee is sour
And the shirt is torn
But the smile is bigger than the Atlantic sea
And it happens to bring out the Atlantis in me

Island of wonder
Where do you come from
Is it the way the sun hits my face
Or is it your memory which I cannot trace, I cannot trace

Eu vejo mais ao longe
Pessoas sem fome
Com p√©s sangrando
Na vereda Florida
And the church bell dongs
A remarkable song
And I swallow the salt
As I hum along
The woman she laughs as I pass her by
In a patchwork (dream) I left behind
Island of wonder
Where do you come from
Is it the way the sun
Hits my face
Or is it your memory which I cannot trace
I cannot trace

Look at me I have so much pride
I took my shoes off I ran I did not hide
Look at me I have so much pride
I will give my dowry for the prize

Island of wonder
Where are you going
Nobody knows it
But it is snowing
In the hearts
And minds of every kind of universe
Every kind of universeEmbed
