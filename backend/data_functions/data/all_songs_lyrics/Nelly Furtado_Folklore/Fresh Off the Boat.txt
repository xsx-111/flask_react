Fresh Off the Boat Lyrics
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat

I rock these bare feet like no one else can
My hands are dirty, I like 'em that way
Shows who I am

I'm fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat

The wine tastes good on my sweet lips like sunshine
The plastic on the furniture suits me just fine

I am fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat (Yeah)
Fresh off the boat (Yeah)
I'm fresh off the boat (? on the mountain)
Fresh off the boat (Hear it on your radio)
Fresh off the boat (? on the mountain)
Fresh off the boat
Djing djing djing…
Querida menina à beira do mar
Querida menina à beira do mar
Apanha um barco branco e vai, vai, vai
Apanha um barco branco e sai, sai, sai
Aquela menina à beira do mar
Aquela menina à beira do mar
Aquela menina à beira do mar
Querida menina e vai, vai, vai

Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Fresh off the boat
Querida menina à beira do mar
Querida menina à beira do mar
Querida menina à beira do mar
Querida menina à beira do mar
Querida menina à beira do mar
Querida menina à beira do mar
Querida menina à beira do mar
Beira do mar, mar, yeah!Embed
