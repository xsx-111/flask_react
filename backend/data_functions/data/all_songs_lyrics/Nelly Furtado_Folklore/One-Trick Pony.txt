One-Trick Pony Lyrics
You say, you're identical to none
But you're identical to some
Who wants to be a some?
Not me

I am not a one-trick pony
I am not a one-trick pony
I really feel no one can own me
I really feel nothing can hold me

Nobody can control me
Nobody can conform me
Nobody can disown me
Nobody can ignore me

So slow down
One-trick pony

I am not a one-trick pony
I am not a one-trick pony
For you I will not dance
And for you I will not prance
And where I was last
I'll never be at
And after that
I've already passed

Slow down
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
(It's got a price tag on it)
And hear this sound
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
(It's what you really wanted)
One-trick pony

Yeah, you do it for a price
I can see it in your eyes
See that role was never mine
I don't want to stand in line
See how that one-trick story goes
If she weren't on top you'd never know
Cause a one-trick pony steals the show
You're just a pony

So back down
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
(It's got a price tag on it)
To the ground
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
(It's got a price tag on it)
And chill out
(Get on it girl, get on it girl)
Girl, you better shape up
Girl, you better shape up
Yeah the ride is so, so, so, so, so fast
Yeah, you better shape up
Yeah, just keep your chin up
No half ass... no half ass
(She's coming undone)
(She's coming undone)

One-trick pony
Just ride ride ride
Just ride ride ride
Ride ride rideEmbed
