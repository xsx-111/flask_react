Build You Up Lyrics
Baby don't believe it
Baby don't believe it
Oh, it's in your eyes
I can see the weakness
You don't have to hide
I can take you under
Under my wing
‘cause your voice gives me a soul
That I love to sing

Baby, they'll build you up
Only to tear you down
Don't give up
Baby don't believe it
Baby don't believe it
Baby they'll build you up
Only to tear you down
Baby don't believe it
Baby don't believe it
Oh, it's good for nothing

You were just a child
Ready to explode
And everything you saw
Looked like an open door
A place you can remember
You'd love to go back
But you can't even comprehend
That it's all in the past
Baby they'll build you up
Only to tear you down
Baby don't believe it
Baby don't believe it
Oh, it's good for nothing
Baby they'll build you up
Only to tear you down
Baby don't believe it
Baby don't believe it
Oh, it's good for nothing

Put your heart in my hands
And I won't hurt you
Put your heart in my hands
I promise not to
Put your heart (put your heart)
In my hands (in my hands)
I'll lift you up, you'll fly away, fly away
I'll lift you up…

I'll never build you up
Only to tear you down
Don't give up
Baby don't believe it
Oh, it's good for nothing
I'll never build you up
Only to tear you down
Baby don't believe it
Baby don't believe it
Oh, it's good for nothing
I'll never build you up
Only to tear you down
Baby just believe it
Baby just believe it
Oh it's good for something
I'll never build you up
Only to tear you down
Oh it's good for nothing
I wanna love you the way you areEmbed
