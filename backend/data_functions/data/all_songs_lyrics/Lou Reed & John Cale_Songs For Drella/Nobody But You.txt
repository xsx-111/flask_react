Nobody But You LyricsI really care a lot
Although I look like I do not
Since I was shot
There's nobody but you
I know I look blas√©
Party Andy's what the papers say
At dinner I'm the one who pays
For a nobody like you
Nobody but you
Nobody like you
Since I got shot
There's nobody but you
Won't you decorate my house?
I'll sit there quiet as a mouse
You know me, I like to look a lot
At nobody but you
I'll hold your hand and slap my face
I'll tickle you, to your disgrace
Won't you put me in my proper place?
A nobody like you
Sundays I pray a lot
I like to wind you up and paint your clock
I want to be what I am not
For a nobody like you
The bullet split my spleen and lung
The doctor said that I was gone
Inside I've got some shattered bone
For nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody like you
Shattered bone
For nobody but you
I'm still not sure I didn't die
And if I'm dreaming I still have bad pains inside
I know I'll never be a bride, to nobody like you
I wish I had a stronger chin
My skin was good, my nose was thin
This is no movie I'd ask to be in
With a nobody like you
Nobody like you
A nobody like you
All my life, it's been nobodies like youEmbed
