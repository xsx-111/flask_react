Halloween LyricsThere is a place you might wanna go
It's right up my street
You might look and see the light shining
Someone you might like to meet
It's Halloween
He says "let's go for a ride"
And he says it all the time
You know you got a lot to live for
And you're gonna be mine
On Halloween
He says you shouldn't believe the things in papers
They can't come true
And don't believe the things that you see on TV 'cause
They'll never happen to you
No no, not on Halloween
2 steps forward
Don't say I didn't warn you
2 steps forward
I didn't warn youEmbed
