Then She Remembers LyricsShe shows a scar where her face met his ring
She remembers the pain but she forgot his name
Ah, it's alright it really didn't mean a thing
Textbook case of a mistreated daughter
Who's been told about some better options
She agrees but she can't forget her father
Oh, then she remembers
Oh, what she said
Yeah, then she remembers what she said
He had teeth like a vise and a hand like a muzzle
He wasn't polite but he had a way with words
On the day that he left she was honestly puzzled
Oh, then she remembers
Oh, what she said
Yeah, then she remembers what she said
Then she remembers what she said  x7
Then she remembers
Then she remembers what she saidEmbed
