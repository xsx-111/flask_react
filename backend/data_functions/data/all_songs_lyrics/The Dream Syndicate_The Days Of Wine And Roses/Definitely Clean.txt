Definitely Clean LyricsI'm just standing here waiting
For you to come clean
I'm just standing here waiting
For you to come clean
I'd ask you what you want
But I don't think you'd know what I mean
Something happens and they call you on the telephone
Something's missing and you know they won't leave you alone
I'm not worried about you
Don't worry about me
I'm not worried about you
Why should I be?
I got a phone call from your mother
She wants to know where you have been
I got a phone call from your mother
She wants to know where you have been
I say ... ah ....I don't know where she is been
Something happens and they call you on the telephone
Something's missing and you know they won't leave you alone
I'm not worried about you
Why worry about me?
I'm not worried about you
Why should I be?
Something happens and they call you on the telephone
Something's missing and you know they won't leave you alone
I'm not worried about you
Don't worry about me
I'm not worried about you
Why should I be?
I'm just standing here waiting
For you to come clean
I'm just standing here waiting
For you to come clean
I'd ask you what you want
But I don't think you'd know what I meanEmbed
