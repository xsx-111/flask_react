The Days of Wine and Roses LyricsThe word from outside
Is she's on the ledge again
Drawing a crowd
And threatening everything
I'm here wondering
Just where I fit in
Everybody says I don't care
I know i don't care
Everybody says i don't care
No i don't care
I'm just trying to remember
The days of wine and roses
The priest from the parish
Is looking for persuasion
The man with the notepad
Wants verification
Somebody says this was my creation
Everybody says I don't care
I know i don't care
Everybody says i don't care
No i don't care
I'm just trying to remember
The days of wine and roses
Her mother says it's your fault
You never looked after her
Her father's arranging to
Get back the furniture
I'm here wondering
Just what the reasons were
Everybody says I don't care
I'm just trying to remember
The days of wine and roses
The word from outside
Is she's on the ledge again
Drawing a crowd
And threatening everything
I'm here wondering
Just where I fit in
Everybody says I don't care
I'm just trying to remember
The days of wine and rosesEmbed
