Too Little, Too Late (rehearsal version) LyricsWe used to talk
About the best laid plans of men
Nothing has changed
I'll just never be frightened again
I'm not going to warn you
It's gone too far for that
I'm not going to warn you
We took every clue
And thought it out in idleness
Today it's dark outside
But now it's almost meaningless
I'm not going to warn you
It's gone too far for that
I'm not going to warn you
Too little, too late
Too little, too late
I'm not going to warn you
It's gone too far for that
I'm not going to warn you
Too little, too late
Too little, too late
Too little, too late
Too little, too lateEmbed
