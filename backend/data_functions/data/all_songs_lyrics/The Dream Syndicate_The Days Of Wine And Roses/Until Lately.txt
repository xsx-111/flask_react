Until Lately LyricsIn my area there's a chain of being
And most of the attention is paid to lower things
Around here the rule is good faith
You choose your friends carefully and you're safe
Well
It just goes to show how wrong you can be (x3)
Because
They say he was in a good position
A man of pride and ambition
Until lately (x3)
Well in this world there is one equation
The harder you work, the better your station (its true)
Well tonight on the news I heard them say:
The man in the plaza had a resume
Well
It just goes to show how wrong you can be (x3)
Because
They say he was in a good position
A man of pride and ambition
Until lately (x3)
It just goes to show how wrong you can be (x3)
Because
They say that he was in a good position
A man of pride and ambition
Until lately (x3)
Can you believe it?
Yeah, lets hear a little bit more about this
Tell me a little bit more what can you say?
(uhh i can't remember...)
C'mon c'mon what are you gonna say about it?
(uhh hold on a second...)
C'mon c'mon what can you say about a guy like that?
(uhh let me think)
What can you say about a guy like that?
(umm let me think, somethings coming, something...)
Well he was awake at six and on the bus at eight
Was at work at nine and at lunch at twelve
At home at five, the t.v. seven
And he was back in at bed at twelve
He was an ordinary guy (x3)
Like you and me
Until latelyEmbed
