Sure Thing LyricsAnd here it goes again
Oh it's looking good again
Oh no, I can't, can't, can't really conquer
Oh it's enough to make we want to shout again
Hey, it's a sure thing baby oh yeah
Well it's a sure thing baby
You know it is
Here it comes again
Oh I can't, I can't start to fall again
Oh no I don't, don't, don't know where it comes from
So it hits me again, again, again and again
Oh yeah, it's a sure thing baby
Well it's a sure thing baby
You know it is right
Oh now listen, listen!
I can hear the bells again
Oh the things are looking good again
Oh no I can't can't can't know where it come from
It's enough to make me shout
Again and again oh yeah
It's a sure thing baby
It's a sure thing baby, you know it is
I can hear the bells again (7X)Embed
