Some Kinda Itch LyricsShe said right now I was stupid enough
To go honey yeah
Beacuse I'm alone I can't believe that I'm real
Yeah like some kinda itch
And then theres a big romantic a bad thing
That goes all around
It's time to stay in bed till the sun goes down
You know I feel some kinda itch oh yeah
Oh those were better days
Those were better days
We were sure that there had to be better days
No I'm not sure
Some kinda itch
Oh it all gets done anyway
But I read my life story twenty times today
Still it's some kinda itch (2X)
(guitar)
Oh yeah those were better days
Those were better days
We were sure that there had to be better days
No I'm not sure
Some kinda itch
And I believe those saviors take me by the hand
I know we gotta everybody get to me again no no
Some kinda itch
Oh yeah some kinda itch
Like this
Yeah I don't need no savior to take me by the hand
I blow the fall and take the car
To get to me again allright
Some kinda itch, oh some kinda itch
No no no no no no no no some kinda itch
(repeat x times)Embed
