With You Lyrics
With you, I felt love
With you, I felt pain
With you, I was me
And a bit of you too
Inhaling and being inhaled
In an all or nothing situation
If I tried to say no
My heart said yes
If I tried to disguise it in my voice
My eyes gave me away
And so we became one
In a mad love, and so loneliness

Had to let my love go, to let it go
Had to let my love go, to let it go

The fear of separation
Became an obsession
Jealousy and jealous scenes
Until the past all tumbled down
And now our love has turned to into smoke
That we can smell, but not touch
A fire that became a flame
That will never go out
Had to let my love go, to let it go
Had to let my love go, to let it go
Had to let my love go, to let it go
Had to let my love go, to let it go

With you, I felt love
With you, I felt pain
With you, I was me
And a bit of you too
Inhaling and being inhaled
In an all or nothing situation
Yes, I began to dream of you in my arms
From this dream I awoke
Cold, knowing that today
We no longer live on
Love
