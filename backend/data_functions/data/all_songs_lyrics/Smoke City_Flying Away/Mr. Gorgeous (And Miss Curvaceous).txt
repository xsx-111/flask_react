Mr. Gorgeous (And Miss Curvaceous) Lyrics
Cool and calm, Mr. Gorgeous
Walks up to the bar and orders and
As he passes by, they all sigh, ah
When he moves just like a panther
He feels your gaze, but won't look at you
You won't get a smile 'cause it's really not his style at all

Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye
Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye

She's so slick and so curvaceous
The way she walks is quite contagious
Eager eyes follow her thighs and go, ooh
The way she moves strikes a chord and hits the groove
But she ignores the hopeful advances
No, she don't give no chances at all

Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye
Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye
Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye
Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye
All alone, our Miss Curvaceous
Back at her place finds her bed too spacious
And as she passes her own reflection, sighs ahh
Mr. Gorgeous is feeling lonely
He wishes that if he could only
Smile, once a while, ah, so lonely, poor thing

Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye
Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye
Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye
Aie, aie, aie, aie
Aie, aye aye

So while you are shaking your hips
Keep your lips turned upEmbed
