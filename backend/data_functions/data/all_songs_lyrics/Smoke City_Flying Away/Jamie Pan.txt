Jamie Pan Lyrics
My friend Jamie Pan, Peter-Pan of the park
With flute he pipes his way
On tree branches he plays
Until it's dark, Jamie Pan

When he gets restless
He jumps above the tree
With a hop skip on the jump
He feels free

James , you fill us with glee
When you move so haphazardly
In our playground so free
Jamie plays, Jamie play, play, play

And he gets restless
He jumps above up the tree
With a hop skip on the jump
He feels free

Shall we, let us take belief
From your book let us take a look
 is a players release
Closer to the sky
But when he gets restless
He jumps above the tree
With a hop skip on the jump
He feels free

Free from Che Guevara
And the others that remind him of the cause
Tormented by the walls
How it's so fucked up and it seems like no one gives a damn
No one gives a damn at all
Oh my
Free, free
Free, free
Free, free1Embed
