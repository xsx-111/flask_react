Giulietta LyricsSomething happened, yesterday
I feel lost
I'm afraid that my love
Loves another
Giulietta, do you know
To be happy we must wake up
And a place to confront with passion
As the body, the body?
Yes the body, and the shoulders
And the space between the breasts
The green birds, the flamingos
The doves, the sparrows
Songs that can be used according to the occasion
There are different types of bite
Dog bites, wouf!
Playful bites, miaou!
 bite of a wolf, oh
Giulietta love this (the religion)
And your lover is your god
And the stimulator of the cold
Your spirit, like this incense it must stay
Smoke on the outer of your loving body
Giulietta
Now you know the Kama SutraEmbed
