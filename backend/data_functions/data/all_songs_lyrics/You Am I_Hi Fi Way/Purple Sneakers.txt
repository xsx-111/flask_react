Purple Sneakers LyricsHad a scratch only you could itch
Underneath the Glebe Point Bridge
And now every boy in a knitted vest
Has got some precedent
So we took a personality pill
And something red to swill
And now every fire has gone out
In every heart that wanted to kill
Let's call it a day
Every thought that once had a sound
We'll have to hide 'til no one is around
'Cause there ain't no room in the city today
For explanations that you just can't say
Found out what shame can mean
In purple sneakers and grey jeans
And every walk to a school that once made sense sure felt like an accident
Let's call it a day
For every trouble you found
There's a drink to lose it and drown
But do you need somebody to feel somebody?
Every day that once had a sound
Will have to hide 'til no one is in town
I don't hate, I just feel better
When no one else is around
So we'll take a personality pill
And something red to swill
And now every fire has gone out
In every heart that wanted to kill
Let's call it a day
For every trouble you found
There's a drink to lose it and drown
But do you need somebody to feel somebody?
You can shave a million ways
To make damn sure that the twelve in you stays
But do you need somebody to feel somebody?Embed
