She Digs Her Lyrics
Your eyes hit a gilded window
When the Housewives' Journal started closing every door
The wind's so strong you decided
That you just don't want to be carried with it anymore

Oh my god, the neighbours
Just can't put a word to it, never seem to write or call
Greetings to the sister
As you're strutting through your suburb, watching ladies trip and fall

She came when he left, never thought it was a big decision
Gave up on lives that revolved around car ignition
Hey, do you ever get the feeling everything is working out okay?

Sunday afternoon sure used to sting until
The drinks kicked in at ten
Now you've got a collective
Surely nothing ordinary, kicking up a storm again

Oh my god, the neighbours
Just can't put a word to it, never seem to write or call
Greetings to the sister
As you're strutting through your suburb, watching ladies trip and fall
She came when he left, never thought it was a big decision
Gave up on lives that revolved around beer and fishin'
Hey, do you ever get the feeling everything is working out okay?Embed
