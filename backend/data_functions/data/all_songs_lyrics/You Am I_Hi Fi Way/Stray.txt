Stray LyricsIt's irregular and it sure won't pay
But say nought 'til you got something to say
And I live for forty minutes a day
Can I have that?
The biggest kick that you ever got
I was paying out on dinosaur rock
And said with every prehistoric thought that stayed
For every door that's been closed
There's another of your friends you can dose
While your brains'll seem to speak through your clothes
And for every handshake that'll pay
There's another motherfucker who'll play
That to keep a legal dose is so lame
Are you stray?
Those born with gold and with weary souls
Should eat their young and die
Are you stray?
Are you stray?
Are you stray?
Are you stray?Embed
