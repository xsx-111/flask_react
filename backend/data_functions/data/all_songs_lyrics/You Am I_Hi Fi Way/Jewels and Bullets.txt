Jewels and Bullets LyricsEvery word they sling you hits like your folks have never been kind
And the jewels on your apron could use some calamine
Ugly girls and pit-faced boys all hunch and join the line
You know the shoe that they lived in
And the towel they dried in
And there's a drink you can drown in
So choose a blanket to die in
Spill a drink on his front and salsa on the plans for a mall and high-rise
'Cause there's only so much of string that patrons can pull and unwind
You're the shoe that they lived in
And you're the towel that they dried in
There's a drink you can drown in
You got a blanket you'll die in
Check out the towel you can die inEmbed
