Minor Byrd LyricsAt my nan's, I wasn't thinking
Over boiled beans and chicken
Something cool fell in my juice cup
Sundown, I could lie and make stuff up
Is that why
My future's so bright?
So strap in and go
Oh, the backyard rock show
Ah...
Ah...
When all city folks got southern
Paint my face up with my brother
Uncle choked and started shakin'
Over whiskey, eggs and bacon
Is that why
Our nights look so bright?
So strap in and go
Oh, backyard rock show
Ah...
Ah...Embed
