The Applecross Wing Commander LyricsWe'd like to introduce you to the nature of our trials
We'd love the chance to bring your elders down
So fix your dad a drink
'Cause you're gonna need to think
And now you're a plane we won't need them around anymore
We done a lot of dumb things now, sure hope we do some more
And we'll wait all summer to piss on your door
The wing commander's sister is a white wine-haired surprise
I can't look far but I can shoot for miles
And my radar can screen anyone over thirteen
So now you're grown up, we don't need you around anymore
Done a lot of dumb things now, sure hope we do some more
It's the last summer, so in our dust you will crawlEmbed
