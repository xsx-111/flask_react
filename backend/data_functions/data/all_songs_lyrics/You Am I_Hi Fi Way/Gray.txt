Gray LyricsDrunk at Cannon Falls
I never made the call
I had your number
It was chiselled on my hand and stained
Fell asleep to the line
Lyle sung "she's made up her mind"
Now I'm the twenty-first descendant of the age and
I don't want it getting 'round town
'Cause you'll kick my skinny ass if you ever saw me down
I can deny it 'til they've all gone away
But I just don't think we'll ever get that other band together now
Tried on all of your clothes
But even me and your girlfriend know
That there's only so much one guy can steal and so
We'll all choke on the slack
Try like hell to dream you back
Of the nothing I got
You know that you've always got half a soul
I don't want it getting 'round town
'Cause you'd kick my skinny ass if you ever saw me down
I can deny it 'til they've all gone away
But I just don't think we'll ever get that other band together now
Drunk at Cannon Falls
Never made the call
I had your number chiselled on my hand and stained
Fell asleep to the line
Lyle sung, "she's made up her mind,"
And I'm the twenty-first descendent of that age and
I don't want it getting 'round town
'Cause you'd kick my skinny ass if you ever saw me down
I can deny it 'til they've all gone away
But I just don't think we'll ever get the second band together now
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah...
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah...Embed
