Pizza Guy LyricsGrab a six pack for the way home
It's only twenty-five minutes alone
At a chance to listen to what you see fit
Put your tail between your legs and you split
Was never one for luck
On a pay rise or a girl you got stuck
Never bother with FM radio
Pop the compilation tape and we'll go
But every dick that comes from the hills
Is gonna inundate you still
Was never one to let something go
To make you hate or pissed at folks you don't know
As his girlfriend steals the last mushroom slice
You hope they never make their movie on time
Was never one for luck
On a pay rise or a girl you got stuck
Never bother with FM radio
Pop the compilation tape and we'll go
But every dick that comes from the hills
Is gonna inundate you still
Nineteen to twenty two
Just Nick, Jaimme, red wine and you
Get into the Datsun and go
To another Mass Appeal showEmbed
