How Much Is Enough LyricsWould it stain
If the lights fell down on your name
And each face began to look all the same?
How much is enough?
Did you ever wanna just lose touch with everybody you know?
In the morning
When you've wiped his taste away
The last of the red and all the records you played
How much is enough?
Did you ever wanna just lose touch with everybody who heard?
Did you ever wanna join a collective
Or throw a party just to make sure you missed it?
Did you ever wanna be a collective?
Would you sell out
To the dealer with the lowest cost?
And you'd burn every proscenium floor
How much is enough?
Did you ever wanna get in touch with somebody you hurt, hurt?
Offered up some kind of collective
So you can never ever be left selected
Did you ever wanna be a collective?
If the lights, they fell
Do you think you could tell
How much?
If the lights, they fell
Do you think you could tell
Just how much?Embed
