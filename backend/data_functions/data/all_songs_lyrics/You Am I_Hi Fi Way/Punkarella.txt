Punkarella LyricsDon't you wish that your kids all looked more fine?
Do you feel that your guy's below your style?
Animal slippers and a drink over Sunday mail
Coffee teeth and a cigarette heart for sale
Any minute now, something's gonna happen
(Ah... ah...)
Everything's falling 'cept the shit you fell in
(Ah... ah...)
Mailman, black umbrella
Doesn't feel the need to tell ya
Sure have been lookin' better
And ego-kissing fools
Are teaching your kids in private schools
Crack another bottle, it's five
Monday mornin', who could ask for more?
Smoking buds, got your girls all 'round next door
Any minute now, something's gonna happen
(Ah... ah...)
And everything's falling 'cept the shit you fell in
(Ah... ah...)
Mailman, black umbrella
Doesn't feel the need to tell ya
Kudzu Cinderella
Them ego-kissing fools
Are teaching your kids in private schools
Crack another bottle, it's five
It's five
It's fiveEmbed
