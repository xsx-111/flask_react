Billy Breathes LyricsTumbling greens
A pickup screams
Alone above the square
Oh sing softly
Above the trees
Where Billy breathes
We float upon the air
Softly sing sweet songs
Softly sing sweet songs
Softly sing sweet songs
Silent scenes
In motion means
I’ll wake you when we’re there
Oh sing softly
Time, it seems
In broken dreams
To sleep beside the stair
Softly sings sweet songs
Softly sings sweet songs
Soflty sings sweet songs
Softly sings sweet songs
Softly sings sweet songs
Softly sings sweet songs
Soflty sings sweet songs
Softly sings sweet songsEmbed
