Free Lyrics
I’m floating in the blimp a lot
I feel the feeling i forgot
Of swimming weightless in the womb
Or bouncing gently ’round the room
In a minute i’ll be free
And you’ll be splashing in the sea

I feel no curiosity
I see the path ahead of me
In a minute i’ll be free
And you’ll be splashing in the sea
We’ll hear a tiny cry
As the ship goes sliding by

Free
Free
Free

I’m floating in the blimp a lot
I feel the feeling i forgot
I’m floating in the blimp a lot
I feel, I feel
Free
Free
