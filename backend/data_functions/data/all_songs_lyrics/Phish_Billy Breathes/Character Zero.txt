Character Zero Lyrics
I was taught a month ago
To bide my time and take it slow
But then I learned just yesterday
To rush and never waste the day
Now, I’m convinced the whole day long
That all I learn is always wrong
And things are true that I forget
But no one taught that to me yet

I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy

I was taught a month ago
To bide my time and take it slow
Well, then I learned just yesterday
To rush and never waste the day
Now, I’m convinced the whole day long
That all I learn is always wrong
The things are true that I forget
But no one taught that to me yet
I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I, I

I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I, I

I, Mulcahy, Mulcahy

I, I ought to see the man Mulcahy
I ought to see the man Mulcahy

I ought to see the man Mulcahy
