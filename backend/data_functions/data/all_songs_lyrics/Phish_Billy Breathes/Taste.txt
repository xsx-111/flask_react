Taste Lyrics
I’m up, and I can take what you give
I’m here, but I don’t want you to live
With me, cause all I want is a taste
For free
I’m down, and I will drag you along and
Around, until you burst into song and
Unwind, and leave your new life behind for
A while

'Cause I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines

I’m down, and I will drag you along and
Around, until you burst into song and
Unwind, and leave your new life behind for
A while
I’m out, and I will stay here alone
And without, someone controlled by the phone
And tv, ’cause what it’s doing to me
Is fine

'Cause I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines
Step into space
Alter my place
That someone else made
Why I have stayed
Into things i could be
Or if I could see
Into fog that surrounds
And pins me to the ground

I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines
I can see through the linesEmbed
