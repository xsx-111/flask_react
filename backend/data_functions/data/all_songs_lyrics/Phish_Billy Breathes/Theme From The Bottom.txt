Theme From The Bottom Lyrics
I feed from the bottom you feed from the top
I live upon morsels you happen to drop
And coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup
If nothing comes down then I’m forced to swim up
On the way upwards the colors come back
But all on the bottom is blue, gray and black
The darkness is cold and perception goes wrong
And the night seems to go on incredibly long

So I ask you why
If I’m swimming by
Don’t you see anything you’d like to try?

Pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth
Jumbled events that have less than no worth
Time in the forest to dig under rocks
Float in the ocean and sleep in a box
Or sink just below all the churning and froth
And swim to the light-source, or fly like a moth
So toss away stuff you won’t need in the end
But keep what’s important – and know who’s your friend

So I ask you why
If I’m swimming by
Don’t you see anything you’d like to try?
If I'm swimming by
From the bottom, from the top
From the bottom, from the top...1Embed
