Sitting on Top of the World Lyrics
Mississippi River, so big and wide
Blond-haired woman on the other side

Now she's gone, gone, gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

I worked all summer, spring and fall
Blond-haired woman the cause of it all

Now she's gone, gone, gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world


I saw her in Dallas and El Paso
Said, "Come back, baby, I need you so"

And now she's gone, gone, gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
Mississippi River, so big and wide
Blond-haired woman on the other side

Well, now she's gone, gone, gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world
