The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion) Lyrics
See that girl, bare-footing along
Whistling and singing, she's a carrying on
There's laughing in her eyes, dancing in her feet
She's a neon-light diamond and she can live on the street

Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day

Well, everybody's dancing in a ring around the sun
Nobody's finished, we ain't even begun
So take off your shoes, child, and take off your hat
Try on your wings and find out where it's at

Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day

Take a vacation, fall out for a while
Summer's coming in, and it's going out of style
Well, light up smoking honey, have yourself a ball
'Cause your mother's down in Memphis, won't be back 'til the fall

Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every dayEmbed
