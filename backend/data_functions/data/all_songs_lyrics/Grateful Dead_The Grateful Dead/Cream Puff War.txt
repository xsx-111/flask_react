Cream Puff War Lyrics
No, no! she can't take your mind and leave
I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve
I can't believe that she really wants you to die
After all its more than enough to pay for your lie

Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah


Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

Well, can't you see that you're killing each others soul
Well, you're both out in the streets and you got no place to go
Your constant baits are getting to be a bore
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war
