Beat It Down the Line Lyrics
Well, this job I've got is just a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
I'm gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
And I'm going back where I belong
And now I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Well, now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Old coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

Yeah, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh huh, that's where I think I belong
Yes, and I, got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, who's waiting there for me
Well, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Ah, happy home (Happy home)
Oh, happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy, a happy, happy (Happy home)
Happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy homeEmbed
