New, New Minglewood Blues Lyrics
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
Oh, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

Well, now the doctor call me crazy
Sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
Said now the doctor call me crazy
Sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
Yes, and the preacher man call me sinner
But his little girl call me a saint
Well a couple shots of whiskey
Women around here start looking good
I said a couple shots of whiskey
Women round here start looking good
A couple more shots of whiskey
I'm going down to Minglewood

Said, I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
Said, I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
Yes and my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
Oh, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their menEmbed
