Cold Rain and Snow Lyrics
Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't going to be treated this old way
This old way
And I ain't going to be treated this old way
Well, she went up to her room where she sang her faithful tune
Well, I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow
Well, I'm going were those chilly winds don't blow
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snowEmbed
