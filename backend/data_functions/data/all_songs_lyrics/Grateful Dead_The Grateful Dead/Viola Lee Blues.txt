Viola Lee Blues Lyrics
The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it
Clerk he wrote it down indeed-e
Judge decreed it, clerk he wrote it down
Give you this jail sentence, you'll be Nashville bound


Some got six months, some got one solid
Some got one solid year indeed-e
Some got six months, some got one solid, yeah
But me and my buddies all got lifetime here


I wrote a letter, I mailed in the...mailed it in the air indeed-e
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the air
You may know by that I've got a friend somewhere


I wrote a letter, I mailed in the...mailed it in the air indeed-e
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the air
You may know by that I've got a friend somewhere2Embed
