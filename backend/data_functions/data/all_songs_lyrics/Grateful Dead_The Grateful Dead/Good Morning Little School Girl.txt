Good Morning Little School Girl Lyrics

Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Tell your mama and your papa I'm a little schoolboy too
Come on now pretty baby, I just can't help myself
You're so young and pretty, I don't need nobody else

Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Don't you hear me crying?
Ow, hey, oh

I'm gonna leave you, baby, about the break of day
On account of the way you treat me, I got to stay away
Come on now pretty baby, darling come on home
You know I love you, baby, I got to get you all alone

Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Can't you hear me crying?
Ow, hey, oh

I'm gonna buy me an airplane, and fly all over your town
Tell everybody baby, Lord knows you're fine
Come on now pretty baby, I just can't help myself
You're so young and pretty, I don't need nobody else

Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Can't you hear me crying?
Ow, hey, oh

Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Tell your mama and your papa I'm a schoolboy too
I'm a schoolboy, tooâ€”hey, I'm a schoolboy, too
I wanna be your chauffeur, I wanna ride your little machine
I wanna be your chauffeur, I wanna ride your little machine
I wanna put a tiger, baby I wanna put a tiger, baby
I wanna put a tiger, baby, hey, in your sweet little tank

Hey baby now, yes I do, ha, yes I do now
Hey, I got to, hey, I got to come on home with you
Tell your mama, uh baby, tell your papa, tell your mama and your papa
Hey, I'm a schoolboy, too, hey, hey, I'm a schoolboy, too
Ha oww, I'm a schoolboy, too, ow, I wanna keep your company
Hey, I wanna keep your company
