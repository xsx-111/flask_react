Rocket Park LyricsThey love to start
The box full of flies
Living in a hand-me-down world
But time was tight
And so I'm told
We look just like my older sister's friends of your parents
So we're just like them only programmed by computer

Life in rocket park
Life in rocket park
Livin' life in rocket park
Life and death in rocket park
We need more room
To grow so totally about you
But it seems Philadelphia isn't all together
So I go to the discotheque and become a machine
But just give a little more time
And Chicago works
In cycles

Life in rocket park
Life in rocket park
Livin' life in rocket park
Life and death in rocket park
They say a man is coming in from New York
They say a man is coming in from London
They say a woman is coming in from Tokyo
They say an ambivalent visitor is coming in from space
Yes I'm so glad that I came to your party
Seems like anyone who's anyone is here
We talked and we smiled, and what's most of all
It was all automatic
Came out the way it was really wanted to
Whether intended or not
And I want to thank the person
Who used the rockets to describe the way of life
In a park

Life in rocket park
Life in rocket park
Livin' life in rocket park
Life and death in rocket park

Life in rocket park
Life in rocket parkEmbed
