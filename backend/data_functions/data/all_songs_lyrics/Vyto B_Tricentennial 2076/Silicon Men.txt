Silicon Men LyricsLet me tell you how it's been while you've been gone
Just so you would know what's been going on
I guess it's OK
For all of us to say
That in a way
We're sort of under new management

Skyscraper City
Elimination wasteland
Every day more pretty
'Cause we eat lots of sand
Because of the nuclear thermal inversions about to ride
The big computer said carbon will not survive
We built ourselves a system
Transmuted atoms
And then we all became specific silicon men

Skyscraper City
Elimination wasteland
Every day more pretty
'Cause we eat lots of sand
I like your new kind of life
You can't cut it with a knife
You can even see through it
(I hope they don't go shattering)
Silicon man is a hit
Well it's high time you went to see Dr. Shuttergaze
He's gonna fix you up 'cause you've seen your better days
Issue some bulletins
Hold the front page
Interrupt regular programming
We have a new champion
Sandstone-breathing city
And glass is what it takes
Silicon man is pretty
He doesn't burn, he breaks

Skyscraper City
Elimination wasteland
Every day more pretty
'Cause we eat lots of sandEmbed
