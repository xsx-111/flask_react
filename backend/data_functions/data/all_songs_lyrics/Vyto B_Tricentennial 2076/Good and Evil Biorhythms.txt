Good and Evil Biorhythms LyricsI'll know
If I know what I'm known about
But I'll show
Yes I'm showin' what the show's about
Your throne
It's the throne that's been thrown about
Minds blown
Shattered blown pieces thrown about
It is just the weekend scene?
Are they really you and me?
What did you say?
We said
'Evil kisses then it bites'
What did you say?
I said
'Evil kisses then it bites'
La la la la la, la la la la la
Yeah
He must've kissed you today
You took
To be taking what's been took about
She's shook
She's been shaken very shook about
You look
You been lookin' what just look about
The book
It's been bookin' what the book's about
Can you read between the lines?
Policemen pay the parking fines
What did you say?
We said
'Good bites first and then it kiss'
What did you say?
I said
'Good bites first and then it kiss'
La la la la la, la la la la la
So he must've missed you today
Well you been bit, it seem
Good startles and Evil's been
What did you say?
We said
'Good and Evil spin around'
What did you say?
I said
'Good and Evil spin around'
La la la la la, la la la la
Tomorrow you're gonna get bit

Good and Evil
Better watch your carbon's biorhythm
