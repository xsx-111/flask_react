The Change LyricsI've got something to say to you
You and I both know it's true
Things just be like they were before
But what can you do?
You wait for the change
It may hurt, oh yes it does
But the truth is best for us
Running it runs, yet catches up
So what can you do?
You die with the change
Baby, It's all over
Pack your things, we're gonna leave
Don't bother with gold, it can't save ya
Cause baby, this time really
It's over
I've got something to say to you
You and I both know it's true
Things will get worse before they will get better
But what can you do?

You live with the change
You live with the change1Embed
