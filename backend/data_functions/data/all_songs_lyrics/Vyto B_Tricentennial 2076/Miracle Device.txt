Miracle Device LyricsRiding around in my miracle device
Wondering where I'll land
Crying aloud it's 'cause things ain't so nice
Superiors please give us a hand

We run out of time
We run out of space
There's just no place
For a sub-human race
The planet ain't dying
But we are
New forms of life are coming our way
And you know they're us
Better tell your wife
What happened today
It's her turn next because

We run out of time
We run out of space
There's just no place
For a sub-human race
The planet ain't dying
But we are
You and me are
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Hope you have had
Enough of a chance
To close off your books
Now is the time to
Get rid of the can'ts
'Cause from the way it looks

We run out of time
We run out of space
There's just no place
For a sub-human race
The planet ain't dying
But we are
You and me are
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
They gave us Martian Plan
They gave us Martian Plan
They gave us Martian Plan
They gave us Martian Plan1Embed
