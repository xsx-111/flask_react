Tricentennial 2076 Lyrics
Big Brother was outraged
Even when 1998 meant Death Warrant
Electronic Enforcer was engaged

Only through Space Love of the Superiors
Were we given chances, again
They gave us Martian Plan
In Limbo you're doomed
To an imaginary life
But what can you do?
You live with the change

Tricentennial 2076
This is where the old
The old America stood
Superiors sent us their men
Space Love was a savior
He gave to us Martian Plan

Only through Space Love of the Superiors
Were we given chances, again
They gave us Martian Plan
We had to learn the Funky Pump
So Rocket Park
Could make us Silicon Men

Tricentennial 2076
This is where the old
The old America stood

2076 is when we made it so we thought it would be good
To write a law for Good and Evil called the New America
And we celebrate, celebrate, celebrate the Tricentennial
When we come back from the past
In our miracle device
We'll stop off in that happy year
And we'll celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate the Tricentennial
Only through space love of the Superiors
Were we given chances, again
They gave us Martian Plan
They gave us Martian Plan
They gave us Martian Plan
They gave us Martian Plan1Embed
