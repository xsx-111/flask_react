Death Warrant LyricsAll you so-called friends keep trying to
Give me a piece of advice
'Do this, don't do that, because you've
Got to make it better for us'
Well for your information the very
Reason that I'm not doing what you
Keep on telling me to do
Is that I have been
Trying to make it better for you
And I would have liked to make it better
But you bit the hand that feeds you
And you blamed me for the wound
One too many times, it's your advice
Never again, I shrug
I shrug
Yes I shrug
Shrug
Take your sweet pain to the cleaners and take a bath
I won't take no more of that and it's that
Shine your laser to a mirror, go ahead and be vain
I won't stand anymore in your way, go ahead, feel your own pain
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
All you so-called friends keep trying to

Got to make it better for us'
Well for your information the very
Reason that I'm not doing what you
Keep on telling me to do
Is that I have been
Trying to make it better for you
And I would have liked to make it better
But you bit the hand that feeds you
And you blamed me for the wound
One to many times, it's your advice
Never again, I'll shrug
I shrug
Yes I shrug
Shrug
Take your sweet pain to the cleaners and take a bath
I won't take no more of that and it's that
Shine your laser to a mirror, go ahead and be vain
I won't stand anymore in your way, go ahead, feel your own pain
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
