Funky Pump LyricsI was born in 2033
They went out and found infinity
Now we can't come back to where you are
5066 ain't really far
Lord know, lord knows, lord knows, we really tried
To bring them back with us before they died
But they just couldn't really understand
So we went and formed ourselves a discotheque band

And time loves to jump, yeah
We do the funky pump, yeah
Well it's been two years now since we began
And I now I feel like I'm a very old-time man
The time it flies just faster all the time
9099 in fossil time
But it's worth it, yes it's worth it in the end
If we can make it
If we can make it, then
We can come back to the beginning day
Do it over
Yes, all another way

And time loves to jump, yeah
We do the funky pump, yeah
Oh well I used to play with the average caveman
But they were just average
I used to play with the Roman Empire
But they were just average
I used to play with the Americans
But they were just average
I used to play with the United Earth
But they were just average
Once someone asked me to play with the Milky Way
But they were just average
I used to play with the Universe
And it was beginning to get fun but not like the existence you get from
Time loves to jump, yeah
We do the funky pump, get down
And now the time for us has come to go
And if you understood, please join our show
The future needs representatives like you in the past
'Cause zero-one mentality just can't last
We hope, we hope, we hope, we hope you see
Just what the time
Just what the time can be
But if you didn't understand, don't lose your fun
Because when after all
At least you can dance to this one
And time loves to jump, yeah
We do the funky pump
And time loves to jump
We do the funky pump
Let's jump!Embed
