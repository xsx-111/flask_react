Electronic Enforcer LyricsYou ain't got no heart
You ain't got no heart
A rigid brain - no heart
You're electronic, yes
And supersonic, but you can't
Feel or love or hate
Or want or laugh or cry or pant
You just do as you're told
Electronic enforcer, go do as you're told
Hideout submarine
Hideout submarine
Spellbound submarine
Their only crime was that they
Didn't want to disagree
They stole away under the sea
And now they think they're free
But you just do as you're told
Electronic enforcer, go do as you're told
You can never say more than what you are
You can never win more than what you start
You can never reap more than what you sow
You can never talk more than what you know
You can never take more than what you give
You can never be more than what you live
You can never sell more than what you buy
Electronic enforcer, go do as you're told
Fried beyond repair
Fried beyond repair
Can't no more repair
The submarine can't seem
To find its way out of the water
In stereo, in black and white
Oh well, I guess you got her
You just do as you're told

Electronic enforcer, go do as you're told
Electronic enforcer, go do as you're told1Embed
