To Commemorate an Imaginary Life that Dies Prematurely LyricsRiding in a horse-drawn carriage
Party down Atlantic seashore
Young girls grow so very fastly
Do believe the leaves will fall
Life it turns then turns again
Caught you saying what you didn't
Social constructs are so rigid
Five years time I'll go to 

How
Can it rain?
There's no cloud in the sky
And how
Could she leave
When she never came by?
Goodbye
Don't cry
Bought myself a piece of future
History deceives the past
Keep the factory producing
Travel and you can't come home
Peace of mind is just a space
Close a door against the wind
Used to march when we were young
Do things only to remember
How
Can it rain?
There's no cloud
In the sky
And how
Could she leave
When she never came by?
Goodbye
Don't cry
It was something
That they often
Wrote about
In the future
But I
Couldn't chase it long enough
Cantor Macabre, he dances
Stolen minutes of your time
We can't all conform exactly
Do things only to remember1Embed
