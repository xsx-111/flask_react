New America LyricsOnce there was a land
The home of the brave and the land of the free
Once there was a land
They called it America
Once it was so good
The home of the brave and the land of the free
Then when it went bad
It died in the end of the world
Now as silicon men in 2076
We knew we couldn't afford mistakes
Like the one we made so we put together a new system
To control our Good and Evil Biorhythm
We used all the good principles from history
And we discarded the bad
And maybe because so many of the principles used were American
Or maybe because it was the year 2076
We named our system New America
And we celebrated the American Tricentennial
Once there was a land
The home of the brave and the land of the free
Now it's just a state of mind
We call it New America
Now as silicon men in 2076
You know we didn't use such concepts like countries no more
But we thought it was a good name
For a state of mind, for Good and Evil Biorhythm
We thought our children could learn from history
And we discarded the past
And maybe to show our principles were grounded in learning from history
And maybe because it was the year 2076
We named our system New America
And we celebrated the American TricentennialEmbed
