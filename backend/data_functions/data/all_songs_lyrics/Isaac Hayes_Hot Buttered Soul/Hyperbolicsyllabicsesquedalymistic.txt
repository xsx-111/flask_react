Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic Lyrics
I wanna come back
Cause I like it like that
Your modus operandi
Is really all right, out of sight
Your sweet phalanges
Know how to squeeze
My gastronomical stupensity
Is really satisfied when you're loving me

Now, tell me, what I say?
Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic

I can't sleep at night
But that's all right
The M.D. tells me
My heart's on strike
Emanating, originating from a love asphyxiation
He said I better slow down
Before you drive me in the ground
But what he doesn't know is I want another encore

Now, what I say?
Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic
Let me stop procrastinating
Standin' here and narrating
Find my emancipator
She's a love educator
Cerebral, cerebellum, a medulla oblongata
A slave's on a horse
Every time she explores
Just heard a discussion about a racial relationship

Now, what I say?
