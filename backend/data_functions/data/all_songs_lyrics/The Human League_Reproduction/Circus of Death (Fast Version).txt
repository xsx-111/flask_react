Circus of Death (Fast Version) Lyrics
This is a song called "Circus Of Death.” It tells the true story of a circus we met. The first two verses concern the actual arrival at Heathrow Airport of Commissioner Steve McGarrett. The third emotionally describes a map showing the range of the circus. The fourth and fifth were extracted from an article in the Guardian of March the 19th, 1962. The last is a shortwave radio message from the last man on Earth

Nine o'clock flight from Hawaii
The Trident is just touching down
We're waiting hеre on the tarmac
McGarrett is wеaring a frown

He's here to help with a problem
A blood-spattered curse on our land
Please cast your eye over this map, sir
This business is quite out of hand

The circus of death is approaching
It's pathway is painted in red
Before it the frightened and helpless
Behind it a trail of the dead

The narcotic that forges their union
Is a substance known only to one
To the clown it is known as "Dominion"
It's a secret that he'll give to none
The drug which gives the clown power
Means the circus can never be stopped
And his dream can go on unhindered
Till the last human being has dropped

Spare me and my family
I've done you no wrong
Go away, please let us be
I've known you for too longEmbed
