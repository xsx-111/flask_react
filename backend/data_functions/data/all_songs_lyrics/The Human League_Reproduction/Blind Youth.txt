Blind Youth LyricsNo future they say
But must it be that way?
Now is calling
The city is human
Blind youth take hope, you're no Joe Soap
Your time is due, big fun come soon
We've had it easy, we should be glad
High-rise living's not so bad
Blind youth take hope, you're no Joe Soap
Your time is due, big fun come soon
Dehumanisation
Is such a big word
It's been around since
Richard The Third
Dehumanisation
It's easy to say
But if you're not a hermit
You'll know the city's okay
No future they say
But must it be that way
Now is calling
The city is human
Blind youth take hope, you're no Joe Soap
Your time is due, big fun come soon
Blind youth take hope, you're no Joe Soap
Your time is due, big fun come soon
We've had it easy, we should be glad
High-rise living's not so bad
Blind youth take hope, you're no Joe Soap
Your time is due, big fun come soon
Blind youth take hope, you're no Joe Soap
Your time is due, big fun come soon
Blind youth take hope, you're no Joe Soap
Your time is due, big fun come soonEmbed
