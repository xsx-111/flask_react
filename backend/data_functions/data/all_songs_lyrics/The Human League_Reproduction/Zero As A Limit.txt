Zero As A Limit LyricsTake the lovebird
Kiss the stranger
Leave the trailer
Take the car
Feel the sound rushing over you
QED
See my finger
The way it points you
Follow blindly
Into the road
Feel the sound rushing over you
QED
See the stranger
Getting nearer
Iron teardrop
Collision course
Feel the sound rushing over you
QED
See the blood now
Overflowing
No more compression
Compression done
Feel the sound rushing over you
QED
I saw it happen
You saw it happen
We saw it happen
It can't be true
The stranger crashing into you
I saw it happen
You saw it happen
We saw it happen
It can't be true
(Repeat four times) The stranger crashing into you
(Repeat ten times) Into youEmbed
