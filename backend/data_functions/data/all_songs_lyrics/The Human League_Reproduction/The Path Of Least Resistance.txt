The Path Of Least Resistance LyricsFaced with the choice, what would you say?
The path of least resistance, It seems the only way
But can we look a little further? To level four I think
Self-belief's the answer, and not another drink
The safe method, the only way, you rationalise your course
Stay part of the crowd, and never find the source
Feel wanted, feel numb, just stay as you are
The truth is - comfort kills, and you don't need that car
So sad, the early grave, when all the fun's for free
Start digging the early grave, and keep it warm for me
Faced with the choice, what would you say?
The path of least resistance, It seems the only way
But let's look a little further, to level four, I think
Self-belief's the answer, and not another drink
The safe method, the only way, you rationalise your course
Stay a part of the crowd, and never find the source
Feel wanted, feel numb, just stay as you are
The truth is, comfort kills, and you don't need that carEmbed
