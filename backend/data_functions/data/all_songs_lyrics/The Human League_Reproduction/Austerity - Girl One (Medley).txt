Austerity / Girl One (Medley) LyricsIn the town
The start of day
The father thinks in sadness
On why his daughters went away
On youth and other madness
I know we don't choose who we love
And malice is so human
When your principle's no good
It's time to find a new one
I was brought up to believe
That to avoid disaster
In life as in your dreams
You've got to be the monster
When you've done your very best
When things turn out unpleasant
When the best of men take bribes
Isn't it the fool who doesn't?
In the town
By the house
The journalist is waiting
And near this place
There is a space
A subject contemplating
You've got your keys to get back in
You've washed your face so you can smile
You've got your pockets full of lending cash
Your ticket to the ladies mile
You brush away a flake of zinc
Advance toward the street outside
You close your mind so you can't think
The hide, the ride, the tide
But the scenes come rushing in
Like eels into your net
And it's just like Joseph said
Another walk you can't forget
But you push into the bleak
Where all the women walk in fear
Another three-word phrase
The near, the clear, the dear
You're a lonely little girl
Who just wants to please her dad
So you thought you'd be a nurse
Just like your mother had
But you make the patients worse
And the doctors know you're bad
(Better get back to the oracle)
The oracle in this case
Is a message on your phone
It says where you go
Gravity has gone
You know this is true
But you want to speak of love
Prediction and ambiguity
Go hand in glove
The oracle in this case
Is a face on your wall
It says where you go
People will fall
And near this place
There is a space
A subject contemplating
And in the town
The sun goes down
No-one investigatingEmbed
