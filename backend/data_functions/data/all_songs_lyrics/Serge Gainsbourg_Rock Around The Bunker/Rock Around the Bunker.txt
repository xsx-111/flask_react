Rock Around the Bunker Lyrics
Y tombe des bombes
Ça boume, surboum, sublime
Des plombe qu'ça tombe
Un monde immonde s'abîme

Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around

C'est l'hécatombe
Ça retombe en trombe, ça fume
Tout flambe, les tombes
Les temples, exemple, sublime

Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around

Infâme napalm
Les flammes surplombent l'abîme
Goddamn, tout crame
Tout tremble et tombe en ruine

Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock around
Rock around the bunker
Rock around, rock aroundEmbed
