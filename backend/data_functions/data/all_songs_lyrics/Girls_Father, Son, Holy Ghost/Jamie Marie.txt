Jamie Marie Lyrics
Maybe I didn't realize
The way I loved the way you moved
Till I moved so far away
I couldn't see you anymore

And maybe all those secret times
Didn't seem so bad until I knew
All of my little secrets
Weren't all that secret anymore

Maybe it's all right
I mean, I went and found the modern world
But I miss the way life was
When you were my girl

I know I never noticed then
Just what it was I had
Up until I lost you
And man, did I lose you
Isn't that the way it always goes?

I know you are gonna be just fine
You know they say it's better
To have loved and to lose it
Than to never ever know it
Easy come and easy go, whatever
Maybe it's all right
I mean, I went and found the modern world
But I miss the way life was
When you were my girl
