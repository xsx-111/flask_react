Love Like a River LyricsMy love is like a river
She just keeps on rolling along
No man ever can keep that girl from moving on
Easy as she comes by, easy as she's gone
Get down, real down
Crying how I love that girl
She's as free as heaven on a breeze
Lay my burden down
Down by the river's edge
There I learned to let my lover be
And don't you know I'd hold you (Hold you, oh yeah)
If I could find a way (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
If I could only catch you (Ooh, catch you, oh yeah)
If only you would stay (Stay, stay)
And don't you know I want you (Want you, want you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby stay (Stay, yeah)
If I could only love you (Love me)
But, girl, you keep on running away, running away, running away
Oh oh no no (Yeah)
My love is like a riverEmbed
