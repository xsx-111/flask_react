Alex LyricsAlex has blue eyes
Well who cares? No I don't
If somebody somewhere cries
Well who cares? No you don't
And Alex has a band
So who cares about war?
If somebody somewhere dies
Well who cares? No you don't
Alex has black hair
And who cares? Well I do
You've got a lovely smile
I could spend a while with that smile
And Alex has a boyfriend
Oh well, I'm in hell
I'll sing you a song
Would you listen to a lover's song?
Would you hold my hand?
I'm as cold as the snow
If you said let's go
I would follow
Could we fall in love?
Well who cares about love
Could we run away?
Anywhere, anyway, only you
Anywhere, anyway, only you
Anywhere, anyway, only you
Anywhere, anyway, only you
Anywhere, anyway, only youEmbed
