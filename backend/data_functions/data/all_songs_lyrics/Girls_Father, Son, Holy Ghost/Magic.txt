Magic Lyrics
Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
It's madness

If there's one thing I know
It's that I'm sticking with you
Nobody makes me feel better

Let the whole world pass me by
Take me to the countryside
I must confess
If I manage to forget
Everything from as of yet
What a success

I feel like starting new
That's why I'm sticking with you
Nobody makes me feel better

You've chased my fears away
That's why I'm sticking with you
Nobody makes me feel better

Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
It's madness

Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
It's madness
Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can see
It's madness
Just a look was all it took
Suddenly I'm on the hook
It's magic
Follow you and follow me
Everybody else can seeEmbed
