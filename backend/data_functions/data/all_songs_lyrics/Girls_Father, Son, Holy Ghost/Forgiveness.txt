Forgiveness Lyrics
Nothing's gonna get any better
If you don't have a little hope
If you don't have a little love
In your soul
Nothing's gonna get any better
If you're drowning in your fear
If you've got nothing but sorrow
In your soul

And you'll have to forgive me, brother
And you'll have to forgive me, sister
And I'll have to forgive you
If we're ever gonna move on

No one's gonna find any answers
If you're looking in the dark
And you're looking for a reason
To give up
No one's gonna find any answers
If you're just trying to hide
From the things you know inside
Are the truth
And you'll have to forgive me, brother
And you'll have to forgive me, sister
And I'll have to forgive you
If we're ever gonna move on


And I can hear so much music
And I can feel everything now
And I can see so much clearer
When I just close my eyesEmbed
