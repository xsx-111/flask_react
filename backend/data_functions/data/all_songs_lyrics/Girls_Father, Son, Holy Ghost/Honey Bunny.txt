Honey Bunny Lyrics
I know you're out there
You might be right around the corner
And you'll be the girl that I love
No one could take you
No other man could make you an offer
'Cause I'll be the one that you want (always)

I've been messing with so many girls
Who could give a damn about who I am
They don't like my boney body
They don't like my dirty hair
Or the stuff that I say
Or the stuff that I'm on
I'm gonna get you, honey

I know you're somewhere
And nothing's ever gonna phase me
You'll look at me and know I'm the one
And you will love me
For all the reasons everyone hates me
And we can do whatever we want (always)
I've been messing with so many girls
Who could give a damn about who I am
They don't like my boney body
They don't like my dirty hair
Or the stuff that I say
Or the stuff that I'm on

Mama, she really loved me
Even when I was bad
She'd hold my little hand
And kiss me on the cheek
And when I cried
She would hold me closely
And tell me "everything will be alright"
That woman loved me
I need a woman who loves
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! (Yeah!)

I know you're out there
You might be right around the corner
And you'll be the girl that I love
And you'll be the girl that I love
And you'll be the girl that I love
And you'll be the girl that I loveEmbed
