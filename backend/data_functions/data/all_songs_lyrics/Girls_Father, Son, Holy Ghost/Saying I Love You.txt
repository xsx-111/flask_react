Saying I Love You Lyrics
How can I say I love you
Now that you've said I love you?
And how can I say I need you
Now that you've said I need you?
And how can I say I want you
Now that you've said I want you
Now that you've said
Everything I said to you
To somebody new

There goes my baby
Heart on a string
There goes my lover
My everything

I hear you crying now
What can I do?
You threw my heart away
You made me blue

So how can I say I love you
Now that you've said I love you?
And how can I say I need you
Now that you've said I need you?
And how can I say I want you
Now that you've said I want you
Now that you've said
Everything I said to you
To somebody new
I wish it was yesterday
Wish then you knew
Just like I used to say
"My love is true."

I hear you crying now
What can I do?
You threw my heart away
You made me blue

So how can I say I love you
Now that you've said I love you?
And how can I say I need you
Now that you've said I need you?
And how can I say I want you
Now that you've said I want you
Now that you've said
Everything I said to you
To somebody newEmbed
