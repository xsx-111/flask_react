Vomit Lyrics
Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em running 'round looking for you, baby
Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em running 'round looking for you, baby

Looking for love
Looking for love
Looking for love
Looking for love

Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em running 'round looking for you, baby
Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em running 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And down and down and down and down and down

Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em running 'round looking for you, baby
Nights I spend alone
I spend 'em running 'round looking for you, baby
Looking for love
Looking for love
Looking for love
Looking for love

'Cause there's something that I get from myself
And there's something that you give to me
Well, I got one
Without the other, well, it's not enough to be
I need your love

Come into my heart
Come into my heart
Come into my heart
My love
Come into my heart
Come into my heart
Come into my heart
My love
Come into my heart
Come into my heart
Come into my heart (come into my heart)
My love2Embed
