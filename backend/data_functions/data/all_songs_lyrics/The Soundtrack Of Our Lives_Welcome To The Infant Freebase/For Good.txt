For Good LyricsIt's big and it's small and it's true
It's ash from a note meant for you
A secret down under a claw
And nobody can see what it's for
A language from far away
Left in the sanddunes of
A place that used to be for good
For good...
It's heartshaped, it's round, it's a cross
A result of magic and loss
It's earth, wind and fire in ice
And it lies between the corners of the skies
A language from far away
Left in the sanddues of
Something we never understood
Nobody knows what it was supposed to sound like
In a place that used to be for good
For good...Embed
