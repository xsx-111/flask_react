Retro Man LyricsWe come together one and one
And nothing seems to get in our way
Well, i guess we've been around too long
'cause we got no more records left to play
A childhood's dream to take you down
A wish to find the keyhole to your spine
But the music in our mind is gone
And nowdays it's hard to change a name
Well, i may not have a reason
To make this straight
But i just have to laugh
When you're filled up with hate
While you try to turn me on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
'cause in your world there's no need to escape
In your world you can't go your own way
Because it's a world you can't bring back today
So why do you cry?
A mirror man in god jr's klan
He wants to lighten up what is past
And everybody waits for him
To see just how long he will last
It's here today, tomorrow is the world
They'll tell you all about it on the screen
And read about his life and dreams
A brand new brand in next weeks magazine
Well, i may not have a reason
To make this straight
But i just have to laugh
When you show up too late
While you try to turn me on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
'cause in your world there's no need to escape
In your world you can't go your own way
'cause it's a world you can't bring back today
So why do you cry?Embed
