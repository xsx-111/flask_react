The Homo Habilis Blues LyricsTake away your state of mind
Take away interactive rhymes
Take away your suicide
You're not to full to swallow your pride
Take away chinese food
I'm not hungry but i'm in the mood
When i belive in you
Take away to something new
I'm not serious but i'm always true
When i belive in you
Take away you latest role
Get away and buy some new clothes
Make a way and get in control
You're much too young to lose your soul
Take away solitude
I've got the homo habilis blues
'cause i belive in you
Yes, i belive in you...Embed
