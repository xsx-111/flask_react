Confrontation Camp LyricsI'm on a train to a confrontation camp
I'm on a train to a confrontation camp
A paranoia strikes my brain
When too many people call my name
I'm on a train to a confrontation camp
I'm on a train to a confrontation camp
I'm on a train
Please tell me when i have to get off
I'm on a train to a confrontation camp
I can't explain, feels like i'm in a cramp
Is this the way it was supposed to be
A respirated chicken that just can't breathe
I'm on a train to a confrontation camp
I'm on a train
Please tell me when i have to get off
Cause i can't sleep and i can't walk
And i can't stand to face your talk
I'm so afraid of what you think
So let me down before i sink
I'm on a train to a confrontation camp
I'm on a train
I wish it went the other way around
A paranoia strikes my brain
And all my friends are all the same
I'm on a train
Please tell me, do i have to get off?
Cause i can't sleep and i can't walk
And i can't stand to face your talk
I'm so afraid of what you think
So let me down before i sink
And when i try to speak my mind
My nose get longer all the time
Protection lies to ease my pain
On confrontation campus train...Embed
