Endless Song LyricsTake a trip in an endless song
Speak the color and it won't take long
Diver down to a deeper sound
Yeah, take a trip to where you once belonged
To stay in tune is to stay in time
And pretty soon you will be mine
And everything will be just fine
Take a trip with the one you love
On a ship to the sun above
Long time no see for a long time gone
So take a trip for an endless song
To stay in tune is to stay in time
And pretty soon you will be mine
And everything will be just fine
Yeah, everything will be just fine
Cause you'll never get out of here
No you'll never get out of here
Oh you'll never get out of here
No you'll never get out of here
In an endless song
For an endless song
In an endless song
For an endless songEmbed
