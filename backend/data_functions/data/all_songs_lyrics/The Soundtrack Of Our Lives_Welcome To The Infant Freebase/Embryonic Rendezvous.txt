Embryonic Rendezvous LyricsLet us swim inside your walls
We're all sterilized and pure
So innocent and clean
Please, let us stay
Let us hide here in your cave
In this quiet golden age
In the love of your embrace
Where we belong
Let us cling to the time where we are half alive
Let us cling to the time of our life
Let us stay where we are
Where we won't do no harm
Let us stay in the light of your love
Let us come and drift away
In your ocean we will sway
We will float here in the waves
Where we belong
Shut them out don't let them in
Let us stay beneath your skin
Let us stay here in the dim
Where we belong
Let us cling to the time where we are half alive
Let us cling to the time of our life
Let us stay where we are
Where we won't do no harm
Let us stay in the light of your loveEmbed
