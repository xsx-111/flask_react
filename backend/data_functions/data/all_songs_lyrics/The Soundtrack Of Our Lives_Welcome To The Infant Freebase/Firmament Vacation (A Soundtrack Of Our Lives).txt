Firmament Vacation (A Soundtrack Of Our Lives) LyricsThey're gonna build a brand new planet
They're gonna leave for another world
They're gonna build a brand new planet
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before
They're gonna build a new dimension
And make a Soundtrack of Our Lives
They're gonna build a new dimension
And drill a hole of imaginary time
They say we're part of an alienation
Better run for the human race
They say we're part of an alienation
Belive it when they say that we gotta
Get out of this place
Belive it when they say that we gotta
Get out of this place
Belive it when they say that we gotta
Get out of this place
They're gonna build a brand new planet
They're gonna make it on the other side
Maybe some day you will find it
If you think it worth all of your strife
Moutains made of over-indulgence
And a sea made of heroin
They're gonna build a brand new planet
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did before
And leave us all here on our own
Just like they did beforeEmbed
