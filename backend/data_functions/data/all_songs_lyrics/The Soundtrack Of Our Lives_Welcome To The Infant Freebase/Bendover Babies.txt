Bendover Babies LyricsBendover babies drives me crazy
When you're dancing cheek to cheek
Bendover babies one of the maybe's
I've been watching, what a relief
And if you could see me living in an adult dream
Don't you ever leave me, remote control and tv-screen
Bendover babies, lullaby ladies
Such an attraction, what a relief
Bendover babies drives me crazy
When you're dancing to satisfy me
And if you could feel me living in an adult dream
And if you deceive me my life would be so incomplete
Bendover babies spread over pages
I've got my x-rated social needs
Bendover babies might as well face it
Fatal attractions to give me vd
I'm not abnormal, i've got my moral and a responsibility
Locked up in anger and frustration
To wind up in ecstacy
And if you belive me living in an adult dream
Don't you ever leave me, remote control and tv-screenEmbed
