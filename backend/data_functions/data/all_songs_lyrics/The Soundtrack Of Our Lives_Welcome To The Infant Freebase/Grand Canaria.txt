Grand Canaria LyricsWill you let me out of here?
Will you let me out?
Will you let me out of here?
Can you let me out?
Will you open up this cage?
Will you let me fly?
Oh, it's been so long
Please, let me out of here
Please, let me out of here
Will you buy another one?
Buy another friend?
Will you buy another one?
Buy another friend?
It's so lonely and i just can't stand
Talking to myself
Oh, it's been so long
Please, buy me antoher friend
Please, won't you buy me a friend
If you ever let me out
I will be like you
And if you buy another friend
I will feed you, too
And if you ever let me fly
I will fly with you
Oh, it's been so long
Please, let me out of here
Please, won't you let me fly out of here
Please, let me out of here1Embed
