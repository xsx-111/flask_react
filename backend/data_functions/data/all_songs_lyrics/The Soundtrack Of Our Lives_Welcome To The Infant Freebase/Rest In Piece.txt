Rest In Piece LyricsMidnight - sleep tight
Been awake too long
For a piece of mind
Moonlight - starlight
I've been watching you
From a distant sky
And it's such a feeling to be home
East side - west side
You've been turning around
For a place to hide
Who knows we'll grow
When you've got too many faces
You don't wanna show
When it's such a feeling to be home
And you couldn't make it on your own
And i always love to fade
Another day with you
Midnight - sleep tight
Been awake too long
In your own barbed wire
Who knows where to go
I've got too many places
But i'd like you to know
That it's such a feeling to be home
And i always love to be the one
Who fades another day with youEmbed
