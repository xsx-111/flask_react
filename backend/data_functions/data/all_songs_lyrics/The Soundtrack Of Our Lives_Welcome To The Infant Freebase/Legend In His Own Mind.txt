Legend In His Own Mind LyricsAnd so he finally got it made
It couldn't end up a better way
He killed his friends and his family
His formed girlfriends just had to leave
He never saw it as a crime
The one and only of a kind
A true reflection of his time
He was a legend in his mind
Another challenge to face the world
Uptight regression of editing words
A bisexual chauvinist pig
No one looked at you the way he did
(he never saw it as a crime)
And so he let you do the twist
(the one and only of a kind)
An equality that didn't exist
(a true reflection of his time)
He just had to let you down
He was a legend in his mind
He never saw it as a crime
The one and only of a kind
A true reflection of his time
He was a legend in his mind
He never saw it as a crime
The one and only of a kind
A true reflection of his time
A legend in his own mindEmbed
