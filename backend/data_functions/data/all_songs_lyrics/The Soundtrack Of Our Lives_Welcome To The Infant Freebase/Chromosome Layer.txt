Chromosome Layer LyricsLiving is so easy
Just by saing how things ought to be
Building is too easy when you're choopping your family tree
Down your family tree
Chromosome layer give me more
Chromosome layer on the floor
Giving is so easy, when you know you get it all back
Leaving is too easy when you really don't know where it's at
Don't know where it's at
Choromosome layer give me more
Chromosome layer on the floor
Please, do it one more time
Please, do it one more time
Please, do it once more
For my best friends just arrived in town
Chromosome layer give me more
Chromosome layer on the floorEmbed
