Mantra Slider LyricsI'm a Mantra slider
From the golden dawn of history
I'm a Mantra slider
An I'm here to give you inner peace
I'm the one who stole your words
And then thought you how to speak
So true
I'm an easy way out exit light
I'm a Mantra slider
The alternative to set you on fire
I'm a Mantra slider
And a host for your favourite shows
Yeah, I'm a Mantra slider
And I tell you what God only knows
I'm an astrological burnout
That keeps knocking on your door
So true
I', an incarnated distance call
I'm a Mantra slider
Makes you keep on coming back for more
And everybody's got a hold on me
Yeah, everybody's gotta hold on me
While I try to stay away
From the ironic dead end streets
I'm a Mantra slider
And the one to pick you up when you're down
I'm a Mantra slider
And a safety way for every clown
I'm double indication
Of the stories you have told
So true
Yeah, I'm a level-headed turnstile-station
I'm a Mantra slider
On a market where you can't be sold
'Cause everybody's got a hold on me
Yeah, everybody's gotta hold
'Cause if you'll just have to die
Just get some reply
I'll give you back your eyes so you can see
And if you never had enough
And if fools are satisfied
Well, all you have to do is to let is bleed for me
While you try to stay away
From ironic dead end streets
So true...Embed
