Underground Indian LyricsUnderground indian john
Mother nature label son
Running for another deal
Stepping on his blossom toes
Making signs in rings of smoke
Find another reservation
Looking for the greatest show
Underground indian john
Your big chance is here to come
Big chief will be proud of you
You're the king of a&r
Signing all the greatest stars
Maybe if you're lucky
You can make me green of envy, too
But it was a little bit cloudy
Sometimes it's so hard to see
Great big chief is just like your daddy
When you fail to make another deal
Underground indian john
Where have all the good bands gone
When you catch the latest fly?
It's another kind of blues
Sometimes you just have to lose
Making all your reservations
Cruisin' for the greatest show
But sometimes it's a little too cloudy
Sometimes it's so hard to see
Great big chief is just like your daddy
Like you never turned out to be
'cause you failed to make another dealEmbed
