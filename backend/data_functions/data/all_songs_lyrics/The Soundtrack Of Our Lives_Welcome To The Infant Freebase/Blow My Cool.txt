Blow My Cool LyricsTell me, is there something i can't do?
Or are you just too hung up to get screwed?
I've got it all but you know i gotta have some more
So let it fall 'cause i really don't care anymore
Well do you, do you, don't you
Want to make a fool of yourself?
Do you, do you really
Wanna be like somebody else?
(no, i'm not afraid to blow my cool, never been afraid to blow my cool)
Tell me is there something i should hide
I love to have a laugh when you put me aside
Limitations try to tell you how to act
But they're too jealous to notice when they overreact
So, do you, do you, don't you
Want to make a fool of yourself
Well do you really want to be somebody
Who's got to be someone
Who just don't wanna be?
I've been a senile man
Living in a garbage can
I'm still a cartoon animal
I still make friends with everyone
So do you, do you, don't you
Wanna make a fool of yourself
Well do you, do you really
Wanna be like somebody else?
Well do you really wanna be somebody
Who's gotta be someone
Who just don't wanna be
And make a fool of yourself?
(no, i'm not afraid to blow my cool, never been afraid to blow my cool)Embed
