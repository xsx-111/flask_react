Magic Muslims LyricsMadame insane is playing a game
Who will break down in your name?
Too many eyes, too many who's in control
Too much fun and people are getting old
Madame insane, love's in vain
I never knew it could end up this way
Don't make a noise, just fall in for my desire
Don't say a word, i will set your soul on fire
Don't make a sound, i promise to rearrange
She finds it hard when too many people change
For you...
-isn't it a thrill to feel that everything is upside down?
-isn't it a thrill to see when everybody lose their frowns?
Madame insane is playing her games
Nobody's child with someone to blame
Push on my buttom we all like to be in terror
She's satisfied when people drop out in error
Too many eyes, too many who's in control
Too much fun and people are getting old
For you...
-isn't it a thrill to feel that everything is upside down?
-isn't it a thrill to see when everybody lose their frowns?Embed
