Four Ages (Part 2) LyricsAutumn's child is back again
Waiting for the summer's end
Yellow fingers all around
And they try to drag you back to common ground
Many seasons have been lost
And this years eve was such a cost
Well, i don't know really who's to blame
When your mind is going in a different way
Autum's child you having fun
And pretty soon the summer's gone
And if winter tries to kill your name
The spring comes back to ease your pain
Well, anybody's hard to please
When satisfaction is too much guaranteed
Well, many seasons have been lost
And this years eve was such a cost
Well, i don't know really who's to blame
When your mind is going in a different wayEmbed
