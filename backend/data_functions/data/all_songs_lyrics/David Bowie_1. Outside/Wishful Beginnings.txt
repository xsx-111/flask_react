Wishful Beginnings Lyrics
Cruising around me
The flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl

Please hide
For the pain must feel
Like snow
You're a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl

Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl

The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such
Wishful beginnings
But we lived
Unbearable lives
I'm sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you...2Embed
