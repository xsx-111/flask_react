Outside Lyrics
Now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow
It happens today

The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And I'll stand by you

Now
Not tomorrow
It's happening now
Not tomorrow
It's happening now

The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and diva's hands
The fisting of life
To the music outside
To the music outside
It happens outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening

Now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow

The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
The music is outside

Outside
Outside
