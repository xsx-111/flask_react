We Prick You Lyrics
White boys falling on the fires of night
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

Mama can I kiss you daddy can I **** you  (tell)
(We wish you well, we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
Want to be screwing
When the nightmare comes
(I wish you well, I wish you well)
Want to come quick and die
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
(Shoes, shoes, little white shoes)
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
(Toys, toys, little black toys)
Dripping on the end of a gun
(Even if you disagree)

Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well
(even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well
(even if you disagree)
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you wellEmbed
