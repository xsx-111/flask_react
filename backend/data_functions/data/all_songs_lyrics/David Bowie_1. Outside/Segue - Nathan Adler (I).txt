Segue - Nathan Adler (I) Lyrics
Old Touchschriek was the main name server suspected of being a shoulder surfer. But he didn't know from shit about challenge response systems
Now Ramona A Stone we know was selling interest drugs. She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was, if you don't mind me saying so, an update demon. Now Leon he couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight... He jumps up on the stage with a criss criss machete and slashes around cutting a zero on everything. I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself: "Whoa! Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all beganEmbed
