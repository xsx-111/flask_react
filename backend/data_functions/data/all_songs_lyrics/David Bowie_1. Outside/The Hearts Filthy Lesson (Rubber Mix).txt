The Hearts Filthy Lesson (Rubber Mix) Lyrics
Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba-ba
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson

There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Motel
The Heart's filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona
If there was only something between us
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies
Paddy, Paddy
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes?

It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears

Paddy, will you carry me?
I think I've lost my way
I'm already five years older, I'm already in my grave
I'm already
I'm already
I'm already
Will you carry me?
Oh Paddy,I think I've lost my way

Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba-ba
Baba-baba
There's always the Diamond friendly
Heart's filthy lesson
Sitting in the Laugh Motel
Heart's filthy lesson
The Heart's filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
And these cerulean skies
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

Paddy? Paddy?
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson, hear's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson, hear's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson, hear's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lessonEmbed
