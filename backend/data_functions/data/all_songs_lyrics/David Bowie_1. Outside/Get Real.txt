Get Real Lyrics
Oh pity us here we angels of lead
We're dead, we're sick hanging by thread
Get real
Get real

You can't stop meaningful teenage cries
From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real
Get real

I'm scared to touch
Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun
Against the voice of doom
Failures fall all over town

I guess I should
I feel I should
Get real
Get real
What's up?
What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?
Get real
Get real

Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel
Get real
Get real

I'm scared to touch
Too tense to be undone
I walk the streets
Not expecting morning sun
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town

I feel I should
I guess I should
Get real
Get real
Get real
Get real
The dazzle of light
The rape of life
The seed, the curse
The jazz of life
Get real
Get real

Get real
Get realEmbed
