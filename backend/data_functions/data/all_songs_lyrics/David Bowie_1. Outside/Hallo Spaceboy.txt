Hallo Spaceboy Lyrics
Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free, don't you want to be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you, cover you
This chaos is killing me

So bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
This chaos is killing me

(Hallo) Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
And that chaos is killing me
So bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
This chaos is killing me
(Will cover you)
Bye bye love

Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Good time love
Be sweet sweet dove
Bye bye spaceboy
Bye bye love
Moondust will cover you5Embed
