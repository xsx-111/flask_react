The Hearts Filthy Lesson Lyrics
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson

There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Motel
The Heart's filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona
If there was only something between us
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

Paddy, Paddy
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes?

It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon deaf ears
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
And these cerulean skies
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

Paddy? Paddy?

Paddy, will you carry me?
I think I've lost my way
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
I'm already five years older, I'm already in my grave
I'm already
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
I'm already
I'm already
Heart's filthy lesson, heart's filthy lesson
Will you carry me?
Oh Paddy
I think I've lost my way

Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Tell the others
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic decade
Tell the others
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Heart's filthy lesson
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Tell the othersEmbed
