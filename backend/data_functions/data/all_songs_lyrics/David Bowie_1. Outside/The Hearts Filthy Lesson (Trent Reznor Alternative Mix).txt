The Hearts Filthy Lesson (Trent Reznor Alternative Mix) Lyrics
There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Motel
The Heart’s filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona
If there was only something between us
Oh, Ramona
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

Paddy, Paddy
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes?

It’s the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon deaf ears
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future
And these cerulean skies
Something in our skies, something in our skies
Something in our blood, something in our skies

Paddy, will you carry me?
I think I’ve lost my way
I’m already five years older, I'm already in my grave
I’m already
I'm already
I'm already
Will you carry me?
Oh Paddy
I think I've lost my way

Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss
Paddy, tell the others
Paddy
Paddy
Paddy, tell the others
Paddy
Paddy, tell the othersEmbed
