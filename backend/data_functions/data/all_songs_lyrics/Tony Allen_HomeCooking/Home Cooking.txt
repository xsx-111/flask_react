Home Cooking Lyrics
Home cooking is good for you
Makes you strong, keeps your mind healthy
Like my wife says
"Tony, don't let me catch you eating junk food on your way"

Home cooking all the time, yeah (Hey)
Oh yeah, soul delights, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking hits the spot, yeah (Hey)
Give me what you got, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking all the time, yeah (Hey)
Oh yeah, soul delights, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking hits the spot, yeah (Hey)
Give me what you got, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ancestral spirits return to dine
For the tasty recipe that is so divine
Home-cooked rhythms are something to savour
Tony Allen has got the flavour
Marinated to blow your minds
Drop this one and you will truly find
That home cooking is the best by a mile
Let the master drummer teach you in style
You gotta have a tongue for the taste (Taste)
This the kind of food you don't waste (Waste)
Food for your mind and for your belly
Not a burger in front of the telly
The kind of food that keeps you strong (Strong)
Keeps you balanced all day long (All day long)
You gotta feed up your foundation
Food for a nation

Home cooking all the time, yeah (Hey)
Oh yeah, soul delights, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking hits the spot, yeah (Hey)
Give me what you got, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking all the time, yeah (Hey)
Oh yeah, soul delights, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking hits the spot, yeah (Hey)
Give me what you got, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Home cooking is the best, my friend
'Cause once you've had it you won't be hungry again
'Cause it will nourish you deep within your soul
You won't be eating junk food no more
'Cause this kind of food was prepared long ago
By our ancestors way back home
Stirred rhythm, groove, just for your palate
So when you chop it you know you've had it
That's why we give thanks before we eat
To praise the Lord for each tasty beat
To women, know your craft, men know your women
'Cause the secrets are all in home cooking
That's truly what it's all about
So Tony, will you dish it out?

Home cooking all the time, yeah (Hey)
Oh yeah, soul delights, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking hits the spot, yeah (Hey)
Give me what you got, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking all the time, yeah (Hey)
Oh yeah, soul delights, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Home cooking hits the spot, yeah (Hey)
Give me what you got, yeah (Home cooking)
Home cooking, home cooking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
YeahEmbed
