Calling Lyrics
From a distance calling
I hear a song, calling me
From the motherland
Somewhere deep inside me
Something so strong
Calling me from the motherland

I've journeyed from a land 
Still, I know where I'm coming from
I feel it flowing through my veins, then I let go
Of  chains
Yes, I let go of  chains
But my spirit, spirit remains the same
Calling, calling me
I hear you calling, calling me

From a distance calling
I hear a song, calling me
From the motherland
Somewhere deep inside me
Something so strong
Calling me from the motherland
It is written here, upon my face
You know, my history can't be erased
Much deeper than the skin I wear
Much deeper than the scars I bear
Always much deeper than the scars I bear
Always much deeper than the clothes I wear
Calling, calling me
I hear you calling, calling me

From a distance calling
I hear a song, calling me
From the motherland
Somewhere deep inside me
Something so strong
Calling me from the motherland

I hear you calling, calling out my name
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
I know, yeah, I know

From a distance calling
I hear a song, calling me
From the motherland
Somewhere deep inside me
Something so strong
Calling me from the motherland
From a distance calling
I hear a song, calling me
From the motherland
Somewhere deep inside me
Something so strong
Calling me from the motherlandEmbed
