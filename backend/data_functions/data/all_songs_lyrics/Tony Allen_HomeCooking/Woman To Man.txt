Woman To Man Lyrics
Yeah ...
You know what?
I just wanna tell you something about, you know
This musicianship, about, you know
Man and woman
You know? Ha! Dirty girl, man
You see, you need a lot of endurance, patience
Everything, you know, to
You have to put everything into this affair
To make your own head work fine
And when you work it out fine
Everything's gonna be cool for you
Check it out, man

Some people don't like me
Say I'm too cultural
Guess I'm supposed to crawl
Guess I'm supposed to fall - No! 
I'll poke you all
And I hope you all understand
If the dam breaks, I'll soak you all
Create my own category for free
But you need to see, frequently 
I'm living in my own world secretly
It seems like only music can speak to me
I'm deaf to the brand name and fame
There's nothing but a code name, gold chain
I faced it, wore it like a bracelet
My face lit when I heard 'Tony Allen'
Clicked my helmet
Jumped off the spaceship
Intrigued by the strange fruit, I taste it
Mamma never told me to waste shit
Bitter to the taste so I quickly replace it 
I detect movement and stay stiff
Who goes there? 
Speak up or get a facelift!
And from the moment she appeared, 
Nothing was the same again, nope
We only got
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle
Woman-to-man bustle
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle, woman
We've only got
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle
Woman-to-man bustle
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle, woman
Man ...
Man ...
Hey!
Woman ...
Yeah!

Huh! She looks like me
Slightly more delicate body. Oo-wee!
Huh! Sounds like a  song
But it's a Tony Allen song with more balance in the funk
Easy!
I think it's her stature that captures the
Need to make a rapture in me
We dance in a circle of awe
Across the world floor and over the sea, sheee!
Is she a person or a planet?
I just don't know but our worlds collide
Trapped in a bubble called pride
Inside, love is like carbon monoxide 
And I haven't got a clue
How to win, even if I'm supposed to
You know why?
You know why? Ha!
Some planets you will not get close to
Some planets you will not get close to
Some planets you will not get close to
Some planets you will not get close to
Some planets, some planets
We've only got
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle
Woman-to-man bustle
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle, woman
We've only got
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle
Woman-to-man bustle
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle, woman
We've only got
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle
Woman-to-man bustle
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle, woman
We've only got
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle
Woman-to-man bustle
Words to hustle, we
Hand-to-hand tussle
Woman-to-man bustle, woman
Woman to man
Woman to man
Woman to man
Woman to man
Woman to man
Woman to man
Woman to man
Woman to man

When man and woman - Ha!
Come together
They call it deliverance
Man and man
Woman and woman
Ha! ... You see
Man and man, foreign land
Woman and woman, for a house, so
It is spacious
Endurance, love
To be able to be together. Yeah? So
Let's not try to -
Try to be together. Be here
Like I said
My endurance, my patience, my love
Thank youEmbed
