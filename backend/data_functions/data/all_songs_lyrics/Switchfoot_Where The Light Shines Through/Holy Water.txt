Holy Water Lyrics(Because hope deserves an anthem)

Give me something I can feel
This time I wanna rain dance for real
Wash the dust off dirty wheels
Give me the waters that could help me heal and
Hold the old me down
(Give me the waters that could help me heal)
Hold the old me down
(Let the rain come down)

On the thirsty ground
Let the rains come down
I want to drink the clouds
Like holy water

I felt like this when I was a boy
A firefly in Illinois
A pair of wings and an electric heart
Broken wings and a shot in the dark
With that fire in our eyes
(Lighting up the summertime sky)
With that fire in our eyes
(I felt so alive)
But now I'm praying for rain
I want to make that change
I got your blood in my veins
Like holy water

Sisters, sons, and daughters
Hold me down with the holy water
Blisters, guns, and fathers
Hold me down with the...
Sisters, sons, and daughters
Hold me down with the holy water
Hold me down with the holy water
Like holy water
My head is aching like a riot
Forty days in the desert pain
When I hear the lies I don't buy it
Still looking for the desert rain and I
Fight the fire with the fire
I want to taste your love again and I
Let the flood rise higher
Wash the doubt away

But now I'm praying for rain
I want to make that change
I got your blood in my veins
Like holy water
(Like holy water)Embed
