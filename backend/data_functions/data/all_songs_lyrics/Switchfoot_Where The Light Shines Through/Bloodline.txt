Bloodline Lyrics
Welcome back to the city at the edge of the world
Welcome back to the city of the plastic girl
Welcome back to the fight you're perpetually in
Welcome back to the war that you can't win

Oh you're breaking my heart
Your bloodline
Oh you're breaking my heart
Your bloodline

I want to break these bloodlines
These narrow-minded confines (Oh)
Are you dying on the inside (Oh)
Break free from this imitation life

I want a hope that can't be killed
With a hammer 'n nails on Jerusalem hills
I want a hope that can't be killed
By your death, TV, and the boot camp drills

Oh you're breaking my heart
Oh you're breaking my heart
Welcome back to the city at the edge of the world
I want to break these bloodlines
These narrow-minded confines (Oh)
Are you dying on the inside (Oh)
Break free from this imitation life

All this time
All this time
Finding lies
Black as night

Break the bloodline
These narrow-minded confines (Yeah)
Are you dying on the inside (Oh)
Break free from this imitation lifeEmbed
