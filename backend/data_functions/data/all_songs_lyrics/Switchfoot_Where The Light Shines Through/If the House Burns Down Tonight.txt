If the House Burns Down Tonight Lyrics
Ashes from the flames
The truth is what remains
The truth is what you save
From the fire
And you fight for what you love
Don't matter if it hurts
You find out what it's worth
And you let the rest burn

The sunset burns like gasoline
Touch me and make sure that I'm not dreaming
I see her face and my heart skips beats
But I still get the feeling that we're half asleep and
There's a spark in the corner of my baby's eye
Like a distant star that won't burn quiet
Yeah, and I might not know what I want from this life
But I know I want more than the starting line
So give me the fire
Yeah, give me the fire

I can hear the motor running down the interstate
And all the distractions fade away
And if the house burns down tonight
I got everything I need with you by my side
I see the smoke piling up in the rear view mirror
Yeah, but I ain't ever seen it any clearer
If the house burns down tonight
I got everything I need when I got you by my side
And let the rest burn
And let the rest burn
And let the rest burn
I've given too much of my heart away
My soul’s holding on like a house divided
Like a match it burns down like a masquerade
And I had to let it go when the fire ignited
One heart, two hands, your life is all you hold (Your life is all you hold)
To hold, hold tight and let the bitter go
Yeah let it go, and give me the fire

The smoke tries choking the pacific sun
We rocket down the road like we're shot out of guns
And if the house burns down tonight
I got everything I need with you by my side
Holding you and the wheel and it occurs to me
We're driving down the edge of eternity
And if the house burns down tonight
I got everything I need when I got you by my side
And let the rest burn
And let the rest burn

Put your hand in mine and
Put your heart in drive, yeah
We got everything we need, yeah
We got everything we need, yeah
Left it all behind us
What we need will find us
We got everything we need, yeah
We got everything we need, yeah
Can you hear that motor running?
Can you hear that motor running?
There ain’t no stopping us now
There ain’t no slowing us down
Can you hear that motor running?
Can you hear that motor run, run, run?
And all those lies that mattered most to me
Were draining me dry making a ghost of me
And if the house burns down tonight
I got everything I need, everything I need
There’s a fire coming that we all will go through
You possess your possessions or they possess you
And if the house burns down tonight
I got everything I need when I got you by my side
And let the rest burn

Ashes from the flames, the truth is what remainsEmbed
