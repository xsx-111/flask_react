Bull in a China Shop Lyrics
I get by with what I got right here
Do what I can with what I got this year
Watching the time on the clock disappear
Fear is all I got left to fear
I got my enemies among these friends
You got means and, baby, I got plans
Give me the start and I can find these ends
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again

I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again
I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again

I want peace and all I got’s this war
I want wings and all I got’s this floor
I want a shot of what I’m aiming for
Coming in hot but they blocked this door
So bring me the music for the revolution
I’m singing for more than just a dead solution
So maybe good living is the best defense
So give me more time I can do it again, again, again
I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again
I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again

What are you waiting for the future’s here?
What are you waiting for the future’s here?
What are you waiting for the future’s here?
 x2
I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again
I wanna rock this block like a bull in a china shop
Give me more time and I'll do it again, again, again
 x4
What are you waiting for the future’s here?
I get by with what I got right here
Fear is all I got left to fearEmbed
