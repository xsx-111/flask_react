The Day That I Found God Lyrics
The morning comes like an enemy soldier
I feel the weight across my shoulders
I feel the shadows getting colder
But that ain't You
This noose ain't getting any looser
I get so fearful about the future
I hear the shame of my accuser
But that ain't You

And I found strength, but it wasn't what I thought
And I found peace in the places I forgot
And I found riches ain't the things that I had bought
Yeah, I found out
The day I lost myself was the day that I found God

Yeah, I get caught chasing my own illusions
And I get so lost in these confusions
I keep on looking for my own solutions
But that ain't You
That ain't You, no

And my enemies weren't the ones that I had fought
And my liberties weren't the freedoms I had sought
And what I learned weren't the lessons I'd been taught
Yeah, I found out
The day I lost myself was the day that I found God

Where is God out in the darkness?
'Cause the voices in my head ain't talking honest
They're saying maybe You made us then forgot us
But that ain't You
That ain't You, no

And all I know is that I still don't know a lot
I don't know how it ends, I'm in the middle of this plot
Yeah, and I found grace for the man that I am not
Yeah, and I found out the day I lost myself
Yeah, I found out the day I lost myself
Yeah, I found out
The day I lost myself was the day that I found GodEmbed
