Healer of Souls Lyrics
All right. Yeah!
All right, let's go

Are you tired, yearning just to be free?
Are you fighting for a reason just to believe?
Ain't we a nation torn by the clashes?
You can send those huddled masses to Me

Ain't we all just running, aiming for that something?
Ain't we all just limping down the road?
I want more than just a crutch to lean on
Yeah, I'm looking for that freedom
So let's go there
To the Healer of souls

You start to wonder who's on your side
You start to wonder what's wrong, what's right
Ain't we human? Ain't we all got problems?
Honey, rock-and-roll ain't gonna solve 'em, no

Ain't we all just running, aiming for that something?
Ain't we all just limping down the road?
I want more than just a crutch to lean on
Yeah, I'm looking for that freedom
So let's go there
To the Healer of souls
Yeah!
Come on
Yeah

Tell me, are you ready to go?
Maybe we could make it home
Tell me, are you ready to go?
Take me to the Healer of souls
We're going down the road, gonna find your place at the Healer of souls
We're gonna watch these scars just fade away, we're gonna make it home


Ain't we all just running, aiming for that something?
Ain't we all just limping down the road?
I want more than just a crutch to lean on
Yeah, I'm looking for that freedom
So let's go there
To the Healer of soulsEmbed
