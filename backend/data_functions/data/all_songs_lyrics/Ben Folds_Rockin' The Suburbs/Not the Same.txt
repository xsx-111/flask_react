Not the Same LyricsYou took a trip and climbed a tree
At Robert Sledge's party
And there you stayed 'till morning came
You were not the same after that
You gave your life to Jesus Christ
And after all your friends went home
You came down, you looked around
You were not the same after that
You were not the same after that
You were not the same after that

You see 'em drop like flies from the bright sunny skies
They come knocking at your door with this look in their eyes
You've got one good trick and you're hanging on you're hanging on...
To it
You took the word, and made it heard
And eased the people's pain, and for that
You were idolized, immortalized
And you were not the same after that
Walking tall, you'd bought it all
And you were not the same after that
Till someone died on the water slide
And you were not the same after that

(ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(You were not the same!)
(ooh ooh ooh ooh)

You're hanging on
You're hanging onEmbed
