Losing Lisa Lyrics
The lights are off again
She took me by surprise
She's so sensitive
This shit just happens sometimes

She's my everything
She's my best friend and more
We don't do anything
We didn't do the day

Before you go
You ought to know
That I didn't mean to hurt you, I just wanted you to know

Black tears are falling down her face, and I am wrong
Black tears are falling, and she won't say what I've done
She's sitting here beside me, then she is gone
Black tears are falling, falling

Remember long ago
Together laughing, loving
Oh so long ago
When we were buying something
Life was simple then
But she's not happy now, and I
Don't feel anything
Her lips are moving

I am mesmerized
By tiny lines
I'm watching as the shapes are drawing slowly from her eyes

Black tears are falling down her face, and I am wrong
Black tears are falling, and she won't say what I've done
She's sitting here beside me, then she is gone
Black tears are falling, falling
Losing Lisa
Losing Lisa
Losing Lisa
And there's nothing I can do
Black tears are falling, falling (ooh ooh) 1Embed
