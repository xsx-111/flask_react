Still Fighting It Lyrics
Good morning, son
I am a bird
Wearing a brown polyester shirt
You want a Coke?
Maybe some fries?
The roast beef combo's only nine ninety five
But it's okay
You don't have to pay
I've got all the change

(Everybody knows)
It hurts to grow up
(And everybody does)
It's so weird to be back here
(Let me tell you what)
The years go on and
We're still fightin' it
We're still fightin' it
And you're so much like me
I'm sorry

Good morning, son
Twenty years from now
Maybe we'll both sit down
And have a few beers
And I can tell
You 'bout today
And how I picked you up
And everything changed
It was pain
Sunny days and rain
I knew you'd feel the same things

(Everybody knows)
It sucks to grow up
(And everybody does)
It's so weird to be back here
(Let me tell you what)
The years go on and
We're still fightin' it
We're still fightin' it

You'll try and try
And one day you'll fly
Away from me
Good morning, son
Good morning, son
Good morning, son
Good morning, son
Good morning, son (Good morning, son)
I am a bird (Good morning, son)
Good morning, son
It was pain
Sunny days and rain
I knew you'd feel the same things

(Everybody knows)
It hurts to grow up
(And everybody does)
It's so weird to be back here
(Let me tell you what)
The years go on and
We're still fightin' it
We're still fightin' it
Oh, we're still fightin' it
We're still fightin' it
And you're so much like me
I'm sorryEmbed
