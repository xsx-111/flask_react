The Ascent of Stan LyricsPangs of silence
From the room upstairs
How's the view there
Do you read what they're saying about you
That you're no fun
Since the war was won
In fact, you have become
All of the things you've always run from
The ascent of Stan
Textbook hippie man
Get rest while you can
So where'd the years go
All the time we had
Being poor was not such a drag in hindsight
And you wonder why your father was so resigned
Now you don't wonder any more
The ascent of Stan
Textbook hippie man
Textbook hippie man
Get rest while you can
Stan, once you wanted revolution
Now you're the institution
How's it feel to be the man
It's no fun to be the man
(VOCALIZING)
And now, watch it all go down
The ascent of Stan
Textbook hippie man
Stan
Textbook hippie man
Get rest while you can
Stan, once you wanted revolution
Now you're the institution
How's it feel to be the man
It's no fun to be the man1Embed
