Fired LyricsLucretia walks into a room
Because she does
It's not the same room
The one she wanted to be in
She says
"Everywhere I go, damn there I am"

And I just want to walk away
Won't you let me walk away sometimes
Won't you let me walk away?
Every one of you is fired
I'm just an ordinary guy
And all I want is to be loved
Is that so wrong?
Don't think that I don't know
What you're saying about me
I hear it all through these thin walls

And I just want to walk away
Won't you let me walk away this time?
And I just want to walk away
Every one of you is fired
Every one of you is Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Every one of you is fired, yeah
(Shut the fuck up)

I just want to walk away
Won't you let me walk away this time?
'Cause I just want to walk away

Every one of you is fired
Every one of you is Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Every one of you is fired
Every one of you is Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Fired!
Motherfucker!Embed
