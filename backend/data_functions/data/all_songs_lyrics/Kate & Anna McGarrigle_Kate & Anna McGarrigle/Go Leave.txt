Go Leave LyricsGo, leave
She's better than me
Or at least she is stronger
She will make it last longer
That's nice for you
Go, leave
Don't come back
No more am I for the taking
But I can't say that my heart's not aching
It's breaking in two
I remember days when we laughed a lot
Those that weren't so good I soon forgot
We could sit and talk till words
Were coming out our ears
Not just for days or weeks or months
But it's been years
Now here they come
Here they come here come my tears
So go, leave
You said goodbye
But could it be that you are stalling
Hearts have a way of calling
When they've been trueEmbed
