Foolish You LyricsFoolish you, you want to go away
Seeking fortune's favour on your own
While the one who stays behind you
Foolish me, is left alone
Sad and foolish that's how I feel
Don't you know how fortune favours few
Fortune's blind as blind as you my dear
What a pity, oh foolish you
Leaving me this way is hardly fair
Must I go seek a fortune too
Or must I wait till folly finds it's own way home
To me and foolish you
Sad and foolish....
Loving you was good love was kind
I didn't mind the payment's overdue
For the price of loving is none too dear
As long as I'm with foolish you
Sad and foolish....Embed
