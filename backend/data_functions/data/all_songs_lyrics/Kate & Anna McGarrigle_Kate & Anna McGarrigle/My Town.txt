My Town LyricsWhen I awake I think of you
Who made my heart break and made me feel like a fool
You led me on just to bring me down
And I fell so low
So if the stars are out tonight
I'll get up and go
On my way, I walked through town
Stopped at your house
But you weren't around
The lights were on to ward off thieves
While you stayed out all night
But it was you who stole my heart
When you hadn't any right
It's my town but I had to leave it
And head South where the climate is kind
And if a time comes when I'm feeling better
I'll be back like the birds in the Spring
Paid my fare and I took the train
I'd soon forget but now I felt the pain
I tried to think of better days lying in my berth
But I pondered revenge, for what it was worth
It 's my town but I had to leave it
And head South where the climate is kind
And if a time comes when I'm feeling better
I'll be back like the birds in the SpringEmbed
