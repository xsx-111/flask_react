Blues In D LyricsMy daddy came to see me
He came all dressed in black
He said, "Katie dear"
"You know I want you back"
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You know I want you back again
You know I can't stand to live alone
I got up from my bed
Jumped back from the cold
Said, "You're looking good"
And I said, "I'm feelin' old"
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'll give you silver, give you gold
I'll give you anything your little hand can hold
He came back on the Friday
He came dressed in brown
He said, "Tell me now"
"Well, do I swim or do I drown?"
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You know, I had to say yes
Because I couldn't let that poor boy downEmbed
