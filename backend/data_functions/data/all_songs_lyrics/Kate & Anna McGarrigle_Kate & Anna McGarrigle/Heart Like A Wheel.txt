Heart Like A Wheel LyricsSome say a heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it, you can't mend it
And my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean
They say that death is a tragedy
It comes once, and it's over
But my only wish is for that deep dark abyss
For what's the use of living with no true lover
When harm is done, no love can be won
I know it happens frequently
What I can't understand, oh please god hold my hand
Is why it should have happened to me
And it's only love and it's only love
That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out
That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out
Some say a heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it, you can't mend it
And my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean
And it's only love and it's only love
And it's only love and it's only love
And it's only love and it's only love
And it's only love and it's only loveEmbed
