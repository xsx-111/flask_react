Jigsaw Puzzle Of Life LyricsLike the seeds of the weeds
In an Autumn wind
We met out in mid air
And fell together
In a patch of ground
And grew to be a pair
But not a pair in the usual sense
As you were much too tall
With curly hair while mine was straight
And I was much to small
We were like interlocking pieces
In the Jigsaw Puzzle of Life
Now the puzzle is faded
Half the pieces are lost
It's limp with ten years wear
Our edges are ragged
And the fit is loose
I guess that we'd best take care
Our scene is pastoral
Naive like our minds
Not fun to be in some times
We want a change from the fields and the skies
And crave some dots or some lines
We were like interlocking pieces
