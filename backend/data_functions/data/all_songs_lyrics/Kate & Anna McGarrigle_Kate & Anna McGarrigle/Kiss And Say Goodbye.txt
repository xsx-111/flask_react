Kiss And Say Goodbye LyricsCall me when you're coming to town
Just as soon as your plane puts down
Call me on the telephone
But only if you're travelling alone
Counting down the hours
Through the sunshine and the showers
Today's the day
You're finally going to come my way
Let's make a date to see a movie
Some foreign film from gay Paris
I know you like to think you've got taste
So I'll let you choose the time and place
Have some dinner for two
In some eastside rendezvous
Then we'll walk
Arm in arm around the block and talk
Tonight you're mine
Let's not waste time
I do believe the die is cast
Let's try and make the night-time last
And I don't know where it's coming from
But I want to kiss you till my mouth get numb
I want to make love to you
Till the day comes breaking through
And when the sun is high in the sky
We'll kiss and say goodbyeEmbed
