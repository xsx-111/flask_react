Swimming Song LyricsThis summer I went swimming
This summer I might have drowned
But I held my breath and I kicked my feet
And I moved my arms around
Moved my arms around
This summer I swam in the ocean
And swam in a swimming pool
Salt in my wounds, chlorine in my eyes
I'm a self-destructive fool
A self-destructive fool
This summer I did the backstroke
And you know that that's not all
I did the breaststroke, and the butterfly
And the old Australian Crawl
The old Australian Crawl
This summer I swam in a public place
And a reservoir to boot
At the latter I was informal
At the former I wore my suit
I wore my swimming suit
(Yeah)
This summer I did swan-dives
And jack-knives for you all
And once when you weren't looking
I did a cannon-ball
Did a cannon-ball
This summer I went swimming
This summer I might have drowned
But I held my breath and I kicked my feet
And I moved my arms around
Moved my arms aroundEmbed
