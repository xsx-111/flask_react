I Scare Myself Sometimes Lyrics
And I will go nowhere
That you can find me
And I will stay there
Until such time as he
Can look into my eyes
Without being terrified
I scare you into sleep
I scare myself sometimes
And it got lost somewhere
On some forgotten line
I can't remember much
But when I do, I hide
From all that I've become
And everything I've seen
I scare you into sleep
I scare myself sometimes

I wanna be somewhere
The security cameras can't find me
Far from jurisdiction
Of anything concrete
Ignore the advertising tattooed
Across the sky
And we'll paint borders on the borders in my mind
And your smile always tells me
That you know something
Your hair splayed out on the pillow
Like a fire orange warning
And we've both had some times
And we've both seen some things
Had strangers dehumanise
That holy scary struggling
Stayed meaningless for the most of it
Now holds a lofty place above all that self-destruction shit
'Cos I know
When I hold you I feel everything

And we dance the only dance that I ever learned the steps to
In the closed-in catch-me silence I swear
I can feel every single inch of you
And after that guilty primal fanfare I swear
You never looked so beautiful
You taste like milk and cigarettes
And that's all that I could ever ask of you
Ask of you
Ask of you, you, you
Ask of you
Ask of you
Ask of you
I just want to be over you
And I just want you all over me
I just want to be over you
And I just want you all over me
I just want to be over you
And I just want you all over me

All over me
All over me
And we'll dance the only dance we ever knewEmbed
