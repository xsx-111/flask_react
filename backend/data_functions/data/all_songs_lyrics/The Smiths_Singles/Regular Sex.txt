Regular Sex Lyrics
And on days like these I wanna hedge my bets
On a house in the suburbs and regular sex
Tomorrow she'll wake up next to some guy I never met
And she'll smile like she used to in photos that she sent
And if I led led you astray or left you askew
I need you to know it's what I was trying to do
My heart still around my ankles at 2:30 in the morning
Holding a glass half-full and a surgeon's warning

That everything catches up
And anything can sound convincing if you believe it enough
Didn't believe in me enough

And on nights like these I lay awake
And worry that my great love's already came
And from this day forth, I'll follow familiar names
Follow familiar haircuts, familiar frames

But everything catches up
And anything can sound convincing if you believe it enough
Didn't believe in me enough

And I have no money, yeah I have no money
Yeah I have no money, yeah I have no money
Yeah I have no money, yeah I got no fucking money
But I have no money, yeah I have no money
Yeah I have no money, yeah I have no money
Yeah I have no money, yeah I have no money
Yeah I have no money and I have no one

And on days like these I wanna hedge my bets
On a house in the suburbs and drowning in debt
And I will wake up next to someone I know to well
And we'll smile at each other and descend in to hell
'Cause everything catches upEmbed
