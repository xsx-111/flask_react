Repulsion Lyrics
I feel your eyes upon me
How should I act today
To feel so unsure always
Give up or now keep on this way
The silence taps my elbow
It's good, least that's what she said
I could run but I stand and greet it
Boredom won't starve as long as I feed it
The world drips down like gravy
The thoughts of love so hazy
Everyone's ideal of fun

Repulsion

Try to wake up, try to break it open
It's not quite the right feeling
I'll just keep on hoping
The girls, they smile and say hello
The darkness drags me back home
It's hard to face it
Still waiting, still alone
The world drips down like gravy
The thoughts of love so hazy
Everyone's ideal of fun
Repulsion

Try to wake up, try to break it open
It's not quite the right feeling
I'll just keep on hoping

The world drips down like gravy
The thoughts of love so hazy
Everyone's ideal of fun
Repulsion
Repulsion
