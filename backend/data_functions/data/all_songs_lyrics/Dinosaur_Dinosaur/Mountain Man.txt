Mountain Man Lyrics
Mining for a sacred lode
Drilling into untouched stone
The world has done enough to me
The horror now I'll never see

Got to fight off grizzly bears
Got to eat, so I grab a few hares
Got to struggle to survive
That's the reason I'm alive

I know I left you hurting
Disappeared with no goodbyes
But I heard the snow cats calling
I'm alright, baby please don't cry
If the guy is right for you
He doesn't live on bear cat stew
I'll live without you alright
I figured you were not sleeping at night


The animals were my first real friends
They'll protect me 'til the end
Where the people lived was filled of lies
And the truth has no disguise

I'm a mountain man
Rip that fucker right off, I'm still smiling
This is a mountain man

Cause I'm a mountain manEmbed
