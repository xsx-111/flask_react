Cats In a Bowl Lyrics
Scrape along the sidewalk
Looking for a face
Had to get out of my room for a bit
Tension is in town and I'm ready to quit

Can't fall out of this hole
It's just like cats in a bowl
And I can't climb out of this hole
It's just like cats in a bowl

See the same old hares
Running to the same old holes
Price of liquor ice has doubled
Teetering, Would it finally fall

Can't climb out of this hole
It's just like cats in a bowl
And I can't climb out of this hole
It's just like cats in a bowl

Ever changing scenery
Drifting this town
Even if I leave
Someone just like me
Popped out of the ground
Loose thoughts go, he slits his hand
They'll be a problem well, Ride it
Gathering, giggling, staggering
Hoping,  has been left from last night
Scrape along the sidewalk
Looking for a face
Had to get out of my room for a bit
Tension is in town and I'm ready to quit

Can't pull out of this hole
It's just like cats in a bowl
And I can't climb out of this hole
It's just like cats in a bowl


Can't climb out of this hole
It's just like cats in a bowl
And I can't climb out of this hole
It's just like cats in a
Just like cats in a bowl

Nowhere to run
Every town's the same
So keep on running along
Hope the sidewalk won't break for meEmbed
