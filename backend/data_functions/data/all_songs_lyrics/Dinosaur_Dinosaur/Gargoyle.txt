Gargoyle Lyrics
I see you every once in a while
Forget where I was standing stood
Eyes glazed with apprehension
Could it ever have been that good

The virgin's escaping
Will is fading
Another couple locks ones attention
How did I believe this fool
Non-stop degradation waiting until
Nothing can ever be the same

The virgin's escaping
Will is fading
Everyone tries their hand at love
It's just up to hope that all in amour
Everyone in which you've found
Best known by its? Cure


Will is fadingEmbed
