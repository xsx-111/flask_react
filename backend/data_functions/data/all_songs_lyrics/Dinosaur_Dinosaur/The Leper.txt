The Leper Lyrics
Embarrassed to be alive
Sit with my life open wide
Your stare is forcing my face open
A leper crumbling, never joking
Who should I believe?

Safest to wallow in my own esteem
Afraid, stick my neck out
Knowing the day has drawn

I'm a leper
Scared beyond this feeling, I dare to escape
A leper
Doomed to this, my life is chosen to rape

Embarrassed to be alive
Sit with my life open wide
Your stare is forcing my face open
A leper crumbling, never joking

I'm a leper
Scared beyond this feeling, I dare to escape
A leper
Doomed to this, my life is chosen to rape
I'm a leper, leper, leperEmbed
