Quest Lyrics
Turning towards a time so free
Justice has finally escaped
The dripping words of yesterday
Set my feeble mind astray

I yearn to see
The glow of her eyes as I appear
A sign of satisfaction
Could be the sweetest sound
The staircase has one too many steps
I've already started back down
Come on

I love the caterpillars
Munching on the leaves
Pitter patter
Makes me forget my disease
Bugs have feelers just like me
And I'm feeling oh so lonely

Disturbed in every sense of grace
The lady wouldn't give me a taste
Of the joy that means that much
It lives within her touch
Why won't you be my friend
I would love to hold you tonight
Even if we just pretend
Why won't you be my friend
Why

Why won't you be my friend
I would love to hold you tonight
Even if we just pretend
Why won't you be my friend
Be my friend

I'd love to meet the one
Who broke my heart
I know she'd melt me with her dance
Her subtle colors, her sweet smile
But it's a shame
She'll never get that chanceEmbed
