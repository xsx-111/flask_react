Does It Float (Live) LyricsThe rain has washed my dog with fear
A question people think, I call a friend
And the next wave is valentine
See yourself call, No big deal
Ever since that's not a fear
Wishin, the lamp would shine
And beam me at it, Give me some fuel
Find a way, to clog it up alone
Terrified, the way you stand
Feeling natural behind the phone
Rain has fallen, the tree does cry
And ? 
And the toads are running free
And ? 
It's no fun to that's what stinks
Bought a carrot and still can't see
You know I've been wating for 6 years
For a ray of hope, leaves me a float
Then I could believe in sunshine
In the winter time, mountains glow
There's always so much to adore
There's a little scenic picture on my skull
See the second building
Imagine, Where'd You go
All I wanna know baby
Does it float
Does it float
Does it float
Does it float
Does it float
Does it float
Does it float
Does it
Float
Does it
Float
Does
Float
Why
Does it float
Does it floatEmbed
