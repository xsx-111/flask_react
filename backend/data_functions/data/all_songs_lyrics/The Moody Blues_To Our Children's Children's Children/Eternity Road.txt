Eternity Road LyricsHark listen here he comes
Hark listen here he comes
Turning, spinning, catherine wheeling
For ever changing
There's no beginning
Speeding through a charcoal sky
Observe the truth we cannot lie
Travelling eternity road
What will you find there?
Carrying your heavy load
Searching to find a peace of mind
You'll see us all around
You'll see us all around
Turning, spinning, catherine wheeling
For ever changing
There's no beginning
You're so very far from home
And so very much alone
Travelling eternity road
What will you find there?
Carrying your heavy load
Searching to find a peace of mind
Travelling eternity road
What will you find there?
Carrying your heavy load
Searching to find a peace of mindEmbed
