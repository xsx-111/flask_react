Sun Is Still Shining LyricsThe sun is still shining, look at the view
The moon is still dining, with me and you
Now that we're out here, open your heart
To the universe, of which we're a part
Everything's turning, turning around
See with you mind, leave your body behind
Now that we're out here, open your heart
To the universe, of which we're a part
But if you want to play
Stay right back on earth
Waiting for rebirth
The sun is still shining, look at the view
The moon is still dining, with me and you
Now that we're out here, open your heart
To the universe, of which we're a part
But if you want to play
Stay right back on earth
Waiting for rebirthEmbed
