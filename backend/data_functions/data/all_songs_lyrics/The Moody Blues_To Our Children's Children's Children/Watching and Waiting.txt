Watching and Waiting LyricsWatching and waiting
For a friend to play with
Why have I been alone so long
Mole he is burrowing his way to the sunlight
He knows there's someone there so strong
'Cos here there's lot of room for doing
The things you've always been denied
Look and gather all you want to
There's no one here to stop you trying
Soon you will see me
'Cos I'll be all around you
But where I come from I can't tell
But don't be alarmed by my fields and my forests
They're here for only you to share
'Cos here there's lot of room for doing
The things you've always been denied
So look and gather all you want to
There's no one here to stop you trying
Watching and waiting
For someone to understand me
I hope it won't be very long1Embed
