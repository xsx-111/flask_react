Higher and Higher Lyrics
Blasting, billowing, bursting forth
With the power of ten billion butterfly sneezes
Man with his flaming pyre
Has conquered the wayward breezes
Climbing to tranquility
Far above the cloud
Conceiving the heavens
Clear of misty shroud

Higher and higher
Now we've learned to play with fire
We go higher and higher and higher

Vast vision must improve our sight
Perhaps at last, we'll see an end
To our home's endless blight
And the beginning of the free
Climb to tranquility
Finding its real worth
Conceiving the heavens
Flourishing on earth

Higher and higher
Now we've learned to play with fire
We go higher and higher and higherEmbed
