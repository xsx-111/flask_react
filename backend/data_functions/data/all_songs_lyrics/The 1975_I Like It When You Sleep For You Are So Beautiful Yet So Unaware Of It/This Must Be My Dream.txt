This Must Be My Dream Lyrics
I personify the 'adolescent on a phone'
Speaking like Iâ€™m bigger than my body
I personify that lack of freedom in your life
And I'm sure she'll be gone in a second

Let me tell you 'bout this girl
I thought she'd rearrange my world
Takes a particular type of girl
To put my heart under arrest
So why's this beating on my chest?

(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby

Pipe down, you're no lover
It's failing 'cause you want it to
Well, I thought it was love but I guess I must be dreaming
'Bout feeling something instead of you
"What did I tell you 'bout this girl?"
The one to rearrange your world?
You got excited and now you find out that your 'girl' won't even get you undressed or care about your beating chest

(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby
(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby

(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby

(This must be my dream)
Wide awake before I found you
(This must be my dream)
I can't wait for you boy
(Wake me from my dream)
What does all our love amount to?
(This must be my dream)
We can't make love when you fly around me baby13Embed
