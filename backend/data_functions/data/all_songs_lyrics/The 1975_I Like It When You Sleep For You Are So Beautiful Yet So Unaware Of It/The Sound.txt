The Sound Lyrics
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh, baby, won't you cum again?
She said "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"

You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do
And I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say (You say) I'm such a clich√©
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do

I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart44Embed
