I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it Lyrics
Before you go, turn the big light off
Before you go, (please don't go) turn the big light off
Before you go, (please don't go) turn the big light off
Before you go, (please don't go) turn the big light off

Early, early
Early, early
Early, early
Early, early
Early, early
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Monogamy, there isn't much26Embed
