Paris Lyrics
She said 'hello', she was letting me know
We share friends in Soho
She's a pain in the nose
I'm a pain in women's clothes
"And you're a walking overdose in a greatcoat"
And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket
"I think I've spent all my money and your friends, oh"

Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again

Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend?
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught her picking her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
"Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist"
I said, "Hey kids, we're all just the same
What a shame"
And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again

"Oh, stop being an arsehole and counting my eye rolls"
"They're like piss holes in the snow" - uh oh
Keeping a tab on my health
Man you're putting me up on a shelf
"Well I'll believe you're clean
But only by seeing your face for myself"
And then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said "I'm done, babe. I'm out of the scene"
But I was picking up on Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris, to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again15Embed
