The Ballad of Me and My Brain Lyrics
And well, I think I've gone mad
Isn't that so sad?
And what a shame you've lost a brain that you never had
Oh, mum, check the car it can’t have gone far
I must have left it on a train or lost in a bar
It’s likely in a Sainsbury’s
Flirting with the girls and waiting for me
I jumped on a bus, declared my name
And asked if anybody's seen my brain
"Your brain was last seen going for a run
And would you sign an autograph for my daughter Laura?
'Cause she adores you
But I think you’re shit"
"I've gotta look for my brain for a bit!”
I stepped outside, it hurt my eyes
“Well what do you expect when you’ve got no mind!”
I searched all day it drove me insane
“Where would I be if I was my brain?”


The nice nurse told me she felt my pain
But she couldn't find a single trace of my brain
"Oops!... I Did It Again" started playing
Forget my brain, remember my name16Embed
