Nana LyricsI wish you'd walk in again
Imagine if you just did
I'd fill you in on the things you missed
Oh, sleepless Knights, a grown up man dressed in white
Who I thought might just save your life
But he couldn't, so you died
I don't like it, now you're dead
It's not the same when I scratch my own head
I haven't got the nails for it
And I know that God doesn't exist
And all the palaver surrounding it
But I like to think you hear me sometimes
So I reached for a borrowed fleece
From my dad or from Denise
Always trying to keep warm, when you're the sun
I sat with you beside your bed and cried
For things that I wish I'd said
You still had your nails red
And if I live past 72, I hope I'm half as cool as you
I got my pen and thought that I'd write
A melody and line for you tonight
I think that's how I make things feel alright
Made in my room, this simple tune
Will always keep me close to you
The crowds will sing their voices ring
And it's like you never left
But I'm bereft you see
I think you can tell
I haven't been doing too well17Embed
