Say Goodbye (The Real Ramona) LyricsI brought this bottle here for you
Can't you drink it?
I brought this bottle here for you
Can't you drink it?
Can't you drink it?
I brought this body here for you
Don't you want it?
I brought this body here for you
Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?
Say goodbye
Kick her legs, kick her down
Say goodbye
Kick her legs, kick her down
I bought this pocket knife for you
Don't you use it?
I bought this ball and chain for you
Don't you wear it?
Don't you wear it?
Say goodbye
Kick her legs, kick her down
Say goodbye
Kick her legs, kick her downEmbed
