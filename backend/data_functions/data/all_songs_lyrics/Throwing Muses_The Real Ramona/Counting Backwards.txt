Counting Backwards Lyrics
Counting backwards, I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember
Counting backwards, I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember

In time, I rope you in again
I try and burn you back through him
I built a tower in my bones
I spill the mortar through my home

Counting backwards, I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember him
I don't remember

Don't let your heartbeat keep you safe
No telling what keeps me awake
One hundred fingerprints I hear
A hundred linger in my ear
Counting backwards, I count you in
I don't remember him
I don't remember

Measure fortune, killing time
Measure fortune, killing time
Measure fortune, killing timeEmbed
