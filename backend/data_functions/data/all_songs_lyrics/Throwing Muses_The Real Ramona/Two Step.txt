Two Step LyricsTwo step, behind the rest
One fingertip too long
A hole, a hole in the box they carry
Pours sugar in the road
A hole...
Pour dimes in Diamond Jim
Two months to fill him in
A hole...
Two step, behind the rest
One fingertip too long
A hole in the box they carry
Spills sugar in the road
A hole...Embed
