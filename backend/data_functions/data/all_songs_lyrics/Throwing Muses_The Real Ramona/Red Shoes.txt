Red Shoes Lyrics
This date
This war criminal is
This date is brutal, it
It wants red, so I got red shoes

'Cause red becomes you
This red becomes you

Eyes closed
You close them in the dark, huh?
What do you think you can't see?
What do you think you can't see?
What do you think you can't see?
You want red, so I got red shoes

'Cause red becomes you
This red becomes you

This dance
This war criminal is
This dance is brutal, huh?
It wants red, so I got red shoes
'Cause red becomes you
I become youEmbed
