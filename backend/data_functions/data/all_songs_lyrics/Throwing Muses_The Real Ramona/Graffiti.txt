Graffiti Lyrics
I see the sun rise over this wall
I watch it break and slide
See my name
See my name on the wall

I tried to walk on this wall
It fell right under my feet
Now I only lean
Only lean on the wall

I throw an egg at this wall
I watch it break and slide
See my name
See my name on the wallEmbed
