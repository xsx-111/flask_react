Not Too Soon Lyrics
She: colorblind, tired eyes
Her hallway aching
She'll never move him - likes it that way
He's just a walker and he'll never stop walking away

"It's not too soon," he said, "you know, it's not too soon at all"
"You might as well be dead," he said, "if you're afraid to fall"
I said, "I know her"

She said, "Why do you stare so hard
Wrapped up like a doll in bad dreams and broken arms?"
Make these old bones shiver

"It's not too soon," he said, "you know, it's not too soon at all"
"You might as well be dead," he said, "if you're afraid to fall"
I said, "I know her"

The last time I saw you, you were standing in the dark
And with a freezing face, I watched you fall apart

"It's not too soon," he said, "you know, it's not too soon at all"
"You might as well be dead," he said, "if you're afraid to fall"
I said
"Done your time, been in your place
I couldn't look you in the face
And tell you that it turns me on
It makes my stomach turn
I know
I know her"Embed
