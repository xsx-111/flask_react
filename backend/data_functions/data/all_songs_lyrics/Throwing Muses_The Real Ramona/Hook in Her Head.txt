Hook in Her Head LyricsPart I

Certain things I love
Spend my time
I guess I'll have to unhook those hooks
This woman literally
Felt she had a hook in her head

Part II

Rip it up
Live it down
Make it big
Keep it clean
Shake it off
Rip it up
Live it down
Make it big
Keep it clean
Shake it off
Take him home
Take it off
Do him good
Keep it up
Shake it off
He's a fucking drag
But if you don't, then you watch him go
If you can, you see it home
You be strong
And when you die, it's a shame
But your old life stays the same

She has a hook in her head
She has a hook in her head

I saw this lady close her eyes
The bottle slipped between her fingers
And slid along the aisle

If I were a man, I'd have a gun
But I'm so bone tired
I'm so bone tired, I'm old

I watch the snow make slow time
I watch the snow make slow time
I watch the snow
I'm so bone tired
I'm so bone tired, I'm old

I watch the snow make slow time
I watch the snow make slow time
I watch the snow

Cover up the bottle
So I can slip between
I will read the label from underneath
I will wear the circle in my sleep
