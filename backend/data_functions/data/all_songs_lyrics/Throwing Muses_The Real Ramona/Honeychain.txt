Honeychain Lyrics
My best friend knows this old guy who
Who keeps a picture in his shoe
He takes it out after a spell
Says, "See..."

Shouldn't stare that way so long, baby
Stare holes into the wall

My dress hangs here for you to wear out
I walked in beauty too, 'til I met you
Here hangs this chain
This thing this old girl keeps
We got it easy

So why do you stare that way so long?
Stare holes into the wall

We're all honey
Dripping through the honey chain
And lay our lives down
Down and pretty
In the honey chain
We're all honey
Dripping through the honey chain
And lay our lives down
Down and pretty
In the honey chain

Please don't stare that way so hard, baby
Stare holes...Embed
