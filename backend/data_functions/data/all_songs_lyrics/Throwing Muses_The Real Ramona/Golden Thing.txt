Golden Thing LyricsWell, you gotta see this
Golden thing
You golden thing
And when you get there, better kiss me
Garbage piled up to the ceiling
Ashtrays shaped like asses
All this money and a golden thing
You golden thing
Hell, I got...
Horse heads that I dance around in
Coked up anorexics
Got a tree and this golden thing
You golden thing
Hell, I got...
Well, you gotta see this
Golden thing
You golden thing
And when you get there, better kiss meEmbed
