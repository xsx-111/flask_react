French Exit LyricsEvery time we speak
You are spitting in my mouth
If I don’t take you somewhere else
I'm gonna pull my teeth right out
Every time we meet
You are shrieking in my ear
If I don’t take you somewhere else
You're gonna make this insincere…
Come on
Everyone I loved
Kept me tangled in my heart
You’ll tie that knot a bit too loose
Not enough to tease apart…
Come on
Everyone I hold holds me
Strangled, sweet and smart
I’m not a puppy you take home
Don’t bother trying to fix my heart1Embed
