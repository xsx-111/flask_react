Hounds Lyrics
So loud
So loud
Slow down
Slow hound

They want to conquer you
Abandon you
I want to burden you
Belong to you


They want to think for you
Pour drinks into you
They want to look at you
While I look everywhere for you


I want to sever you
Defend against you
I want to speak for you
As if I know what youâ€™ll doEmbed
