No Widows Lyrics
If I never get back home
There's no garden overgrown
No widows in the walls
No widows left alone

No shirts to hang or fold
No kid out in the cold
No widows on the walls
No widows on the phone

If I'm stuck out here alone
If I'm stranded here all year
With just nothing left at home
No widows disappear

If the wheels jump off the road
There's no widows left to know
No perfect love above
No punishment below

When they shake, say the wings won't break
When they shake, say the wings won't break
If I'm stuck out here alone
If I'm stranded here all year
With just nothing left at home
No widows disappear

If the wheels jump off the road
There's no widows left to know
No perfect love above
No punishment below

When they shake, say the wings won't break
When they shake, say the wings won't break2Embed
