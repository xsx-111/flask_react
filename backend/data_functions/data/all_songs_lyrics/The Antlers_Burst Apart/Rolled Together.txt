Rolled Together Lyrics
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart

Rolled together we're about to burst apart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together we're about to burst apart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together we're about to burst apart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together we're about to burst apart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together we're about to burst apart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together we're about to burst apart
Rolled together with a burning paper heart
Rolled together we're about to burst apartEmbed
