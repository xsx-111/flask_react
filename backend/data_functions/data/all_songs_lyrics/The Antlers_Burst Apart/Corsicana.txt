Corsicana LyricsBy the time that we woke up
We couldn't stop the sparks
We couldn't see outside
When the curtains fell apart
We couldn't hear the books
When the pages curled away
We should shut that window we both left open now
We lost our chance to run
Now the door's too hot to touch
We should hold our breath with mouths together now
Ooohhhh......1Embed
