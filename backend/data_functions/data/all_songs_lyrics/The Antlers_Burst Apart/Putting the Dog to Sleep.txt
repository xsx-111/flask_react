Putting the Dog to Sleep LyricsProve to me I'm not gonna die alone
Put your arm 'round my collarbone
And open the door
Don't lie to me if you're putting the dog to sleep
That pet you just couldn't keep
And couldn't afford
Well, prove to me I'm not gonna die alone
Unstitch that shit I've sewn
To close up the hole that tore through my skin
Well my trust in you is a dog with a broken leg
Tendons too torn to beg for you to let me back in
You said, “I can't prove to you you're not gonna die alone
But trust me to take you home
To clean up that blood all over your paws
You can't keep running out
Kicking yourself off the bed
Kicking yourself in the head
Because you're kicking me too.”
Put your trust in me
I'm not gonna die alone
Put your trust in me
I'm not gonna die alone… I don't think so...
Put your trust in me
I'm not gonna die alone
Put your trust in me
I'm not gonna die alone… I don't think so...9Embed
