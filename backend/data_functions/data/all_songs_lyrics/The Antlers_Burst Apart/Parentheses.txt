Parentheses LyricsOne broken wing
Soaring and suffering
Arm in a sling
I don't owe you anything
I’m a bad absentee
You know when I want to leave
So close up your knees
And I'll close your parentheses
I’m a bad amputee
With no phantom memory
So close up your knees
And I'll close your parenthesesEmbed
