Tongue Tied LyricsHere we are, tongue tied
Before we collide
Here we are, tongue tied
Before we collide
Here we are, tongue tied
Before we collide
Before the dawn breaks
Before we untie
Here we are, tongue tied
Before we collide
Before the dawn breaks
Before we untie
Before we are tired
Before we're alive
Long before you change your mind
That's where it starts
That's where it starts to come clear
That we are one
Here we are, tongue tied
Before we collide
Before the dawn breaks
We're all out of time
Maybe it subsides
Before we align
It's long before you change your mindEmbed
