French Exit (SNRF version) LyricsEvery time we speak, you are spitting in my mouth
If I don’t take you somewhere else, I’m gonna pull my teeth right out
Every time we meet, you are shrieking in my ear
If I don’t take you somewhere else, you’re gonna make this insincere…
Come on
Everyone I loved kept me tangled in my heart
You’ll tie that knot a bit too loose, not enough to tease apart…
Come on
Everyone I hold holds me strangled, sweet and smart
I’m not a puppy you take home, don’t bother trying to fix my heartEmbed
