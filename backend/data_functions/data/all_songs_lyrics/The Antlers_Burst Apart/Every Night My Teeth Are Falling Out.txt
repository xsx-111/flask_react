Every Night My Teeth Are Falling Out Lyrics
One bad night I’ll hold the glass until the glass can hold me down
And one bad night I’ll spill and spill until my feet begin to drown
One bad night I’ll hear you calling me to help you not pass out

You and I, divine but not devout
Every night my teeth are falling out

Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Get your jaw off the floor
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Get your jaw off the floor

One dumb night I’ll make a point to take an old verboten route
And one dumb night I’ll take you out, to the bar we've both blacked out
One dumb night two bad decisions don’t divide to cancel out

You and I, divorced but not devout
Every night my teeth are falling out
Every night my teeth are falling out
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Get your jaw off the floor
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Get your jaw off the floor
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Get your jaw off the floor
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it
Get your jaw off the floor
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it, try it, try it
Get your jaw off the floor
Try it, try it, try it
Try it, try it
Try it, try it...
Every night my teeth are falling out3Embed
