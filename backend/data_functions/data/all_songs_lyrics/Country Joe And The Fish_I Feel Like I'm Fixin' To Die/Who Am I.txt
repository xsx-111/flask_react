Who Am I LyricsWho am I
To stand and wonder, to wait
While the wheels of fate
Slowly grind my life away
Who am I?
There were some things that I loved one time
But the dreams are gone I thought were mine
And the hidden tears that once could fall
Now burn inside at the thought of all
The years of waste, the years of crime
Passions of a heart so blind;
To think that, but even still
As I stand exposed, my feelings are felt
And I cry into the echo of my loneliness
Who am I
To stand and wonder, to wait
While the wheels of fate
Slowly grind my life away
Who am I?
What a nothing I've made of life
The empty words, the coward's plight
To be pushed and passed from hand to hand
Never daring to speak, never daring to stand
And the emptiness of my family's eyes
Reminds me over and over of lies
And promises and deeds undone
And now again I want to run
But now there is nowhere to run to
Who am I
To stand and wonder, to wait
While the wheels of fate
Slowly grind my life away
Who am I?
And now my friend we meet again
We shall see which one will bend
Under the strain of death's golden eyes
Which one of us shall win the prize
To live and which one will die
'Tis I, my friend, yes 'tis I
Shall kill to live again and again
To clutch the throat of sweet revenge
For life is here only for the taking
Who am I
To stand and wonder, to wait
While the wheels of fate
Slowly grind my life away
Who am I? Who am I?1Embed
