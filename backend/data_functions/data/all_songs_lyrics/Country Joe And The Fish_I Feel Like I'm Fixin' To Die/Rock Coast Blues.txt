Rock Coast Blues LyricsMovin' down that rock coast line
Oh, nothin' but my woman on my mind
Hear those waves poundin' on sand
Smell that sea air blowin' inland
I wonder if she's found another man, oh!
Black stone roadway by the sea
Oh, I wonder if she's a-missing me
Four-wheeled clock keeps tickin' off time
Measured minutes by a broken white line
Wonder if I'm really on her mind, oh
And now in my thoughts I feel her eyes
Feel her smilin' by my side
Then I turn around and see
There's nobody sittin' here but me, yeah!
Rubber tired, oh lonesome song
Tells me that I've done something wrong
Days before and then we parted
I wonder why I even started
Thinkin' I've been gone far too long
Moving past those rocks and waves
I wonder how she spends her days
Watch the sun as we go by
Throwin' colors off the water sky
Thinkin' about the rainbows in my baby's eyes
Movin' past those pine-cone trees
Sorry that I had to leave
High above on a twisted road
Oceans movin' down below
I wonder just how far I have to go
Now in my thoughts I feel her eyes
Feel her smilin' by my side
Oh, then I turn around and see
There's nobody sittin' here but me, yeah!
Rubber tired, oh, lonesome song
Tells me that I've done something wrong
Days before and then we parted
I wonder why I even started
Thinkin' I've been gone far too long
Yeah, I've been gone too long
Oh, now don't you know I've been gone too long, oh yeah
Yeah woman, oh I've been gone too long, yeah
Yeah now little girl, I'm coming home, yes
Mmm, you know that I'm coming on home
Yeah, you know ...Embed
