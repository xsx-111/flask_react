Magoo LyricsSometimes when I look into your eyes
The hurt and pain I see makes me want to cry
The stars are so big and the earth is so small
Stay as you are, stay as you are
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
The beauty that I see makes me want to cry
The stars are so big and the earth is so small
Stay as you are, stay as you are Life before death
Stay as you are, stay as you are Life before death
Stay as you are, stay as you are Life before death
