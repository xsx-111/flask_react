Thought Dream LyricsNow I want everybody here who feels the spirit of the song
And that means all you people out there in record land
To sing along with your old friends Country Joe & The Fish
We will say an old time prayer as we look up to the sky and we ask the Lord
Please, don't you drop that H-bomb on me, go and drop it on yourself, alright ...
Well, I said please, please don't drop
Don't drop that H-bomb, H-bomb on me
Yeah, I said please, please don't drop
Don't drop that H-bomb on me
Yeah, I said please, please don't drop
Don't drop that H-bomb on me, yes
Well you can drop it
Oh, you can drop it on yourself
I walk through the scented air of summer's blooming
Into the frozen air of winter's dying
And as tears inside me fall
The pain of old wounds calls me to mend them
And I realize once more
That things done before have no ending
I feel the cold of eve slowly waning
As sun burst rays of warmth overtake me
And the twisted seeds of doubt
Which spread my sins about lie parched and withered
And the present, not the past
Claims me at the last for it's not over
Well I said please, please don't drop
Don't drop that H-bomb, H-bomb on me
Yeah I said please, please don't drop
Don't drop that H-bomb on me
Yeah I said please, please don't drop
Don't drop that H-bomb on me ...
Hands up Charlie and-uh...
Now if you're tired or a bit run down
Can't seem to getcha feet off the ground
Maybe you oughta try a little bit of L.S.D
Only if you want to
Shake your head and rattle your brain
Make you act just a bit insane
Give you all the psychic energy you need
Eat flowers and kiss babies
L.S.D. for you and meEmbed
