No Ordinary Love Lyrics
Say, ma-mum, ma-mum-mum
Ma-mum, ma-mum-mum
Ma-mum, ma-mum-mum
Ma-mum, ma-mum-mum
Ma-mum, ma-mum-mum
Ma-mum, ma-mum-mum

Momma never said it would be like this
I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it's just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted
She never told me, but if she tried
I was a little too young, and it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfillin', it's simply killing
And over-spillin' on me

Goes on and on and on and on and on
(It's over-spillin' on me)
Goes on and on and on and on and on
(It goes on and on, y'all)

This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
(Gonna tell everyone up under the sun)
This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun (Tell everyone)
Say, ma-mum, ma-mum-mum
Ma-mum, ma-mum-mum

Well, I refuse to believe we're a dying breed
Children of peace, hope and harmony
Ordinary folks, extraordinary love
Something from above, something we fall short of
You can't see it with an untrained eye
But if you take a little time, you are sure to find it
We complicate somethin' so basic
But once you taste it, you gon' chase it like me

It goes on and on, y'all (On and on)
It goes on and on (Hey-yeah)

This ain't no ordinary
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
(Gonna tell everyone up under the sun)
This ain't no ordinary (No ordinary)
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun (Tell everyone)
This ain't no ordinary (This ain't no ordinary)
This ain't no ordinary love (No ordinary)
This ain't no ordinary (This ain't no...)
(Gonna tell everyone up under the sun) (...ordinary love)
(Say what)
(Say what)
Ay-oh, here we go
(Open up the gates and let it flow)
Ay-oh, here we go
(Love's gonna take us higher) (Higher)
Ay-oh, here we go
(Open up the gates and let it flow)
Ay-oh, here we go
(Love's gonna take us higher)
This ain't no ordinary

This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun (Tell everyone, yeah)
This ain't no ordinary (No ordinary)
This ain't no ordinary love (No ordinary)
This ain't no ordinary
(Gonna tell everyone, tell everyone)
This ain't no ordinary (This ain't no ordinary)
This ain't no ordinary love
This ain't no ordinary (It's extraordinary love)
(Gonna tell everyone, tell everyone, yeah)
This ain't no ordinary (No ordinary)
It's extraordinary love (Gonna tell everyone, tell everyone)
(Ain't no ordinary)
This ain't no ordinary (Ain't no ordinary)
It's extraordinary loveEmbed
