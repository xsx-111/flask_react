Ignition (Hot Wired Remix) Lyrics
Start it up...
Start-start-s-

Start it up, turn it on
We can ride this storm
A grip o' hope in our hands
For the comin' dawn
Up to our necks in complexities
Causin' us to pause
As we collect our thoughts

So don't blink when you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'til we see the mornin'
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits

Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)

Comatose, half-hearted
Room temperature's fine
Sleep walking', no dream is even fillin' our minds
Earth shakin', we be quakin'
Like a wake-up bomb
This ain't no trouble overseas
No Vietnam

So don't blink when you wanna come cross the border
Take a look around or come test the water
We won't stop 'til we see the mornin'
So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, take it up a notch)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)
Take it up a notch

Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition
Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition

(Sleepwalkin', I'm sleepwalkin')
(Sleepwalkin', I'm still talkin')
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
(Sleepwalkin', I'm sleepwalkin')
Jumpstart my heart and wake the sleeper inside
(Sleepwalkin', I'm still talkin')
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Jumpstart my heart and wake the sleeper inside
Hold up the flag cause it's ride or die
Hold up the flag cause it's ride or die

(Come cross the, come cross the border, the border...)
(Come test the, come test the water, the water...)
(So welcome to the, welcome to the, welcome to the)
(Welcome to the quiet, welcome to the quiet, welcome to the)
(Quiet, to the quiet before the storm hits)
Turn on, turn on...
Come on, come on...
Turn on, turn on...
Come on, come on...

(Turn...) Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
(...on) Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition
(Turn...) Turn on, turn on the ignition, everybody
(...on) Come on, come on, and turn on the ignition

(Turn on) Come spark the parts in me that all but died
(Turn on) Jumpstart my heart and wake the sleeper inside
(Turn on) Come spark the parts in me that all but died
(Turn on) Jumpstart my heart and wake the sleeper insideEmbed
