All In (Letting Go)  Lyrics
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)

Why's it always circumstantial?
Never any real potential
Obvious and so sequential
It always ends the same (Always ends the same)
Holdin' out with all that's in me
Is it worth all this pretending?
A story with an ugly ending
It's never worth the pain

So right here and now, I am all in

'Cause I'm letting go of everything I am
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
And I'm holding on to everything You are
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
I'm letting go of everything I once was
I'm all in
I'm fallin' into Your arms again
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
(All in)

Can we just wait out the weather?
I could stay right here forever
Gotta get myself together
Real life is on the way
Call it my foregone conclusion
I'll always welcome Your intrusion
'Cause You're the master of my choosing
I'm all Yours

'Cause I'm letting go of everything I am
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
And I'm holding on to everything You are
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
I'm letting go of everything I once was
I'm all in, I'm all in
I'm fallin' into Your arms again

This time I'm so for real (Come on)
It's time I sealed the deal (Come on)
Shut down my lame appeals
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
I'll throw caution to the sky (Come on)
Kiss all my fears goodbye (Come on)
This time, it's do or die
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
(Letting go, letting go, letting go...)
(Oh...)

I'm letting go of everything I am
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
And I'm holding on to everything You are
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
I'm letting go of everything I once was
I'm all in, I'm all in
I'm letting go of everything I am
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
And I'm holding on to everything You are
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go)
I'm letting go of everything I once was
I'm all in
I'm fallin' into Your arms again

(I'm letting go, I'm letting go) Into Your arms again
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go) Into Your arms again
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go) Into Your arms again
(I'm letting go, I'm letting go) I'm all in
I'm all in
I'm all in
