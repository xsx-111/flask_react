No Signal Lyrics
I'm on Flight 92, stuck on this runway (Yeah)
Waitin' for a storm to pass before we take (Yeah)
Off, I just wanna get home, Lord (Yeah)
I'm gettin' no signal on my cellular phone

I got my wife and my kids waitin' for their daddy (Yeah)
At the baggage claim, Lord, I miss my family (Yeah)
(I just wanna get home, Lord)
(I'm getting no signal on my cellular phone...)

I just wanna wake up, talk to the mornin' sun
Kiss my Mandy on the cheek, grab some breakfast and run
I love my family, Lord, bless my family
Please tell my family I'll be home soon
I love my kids, you know they love their dad
And I'm with them no matter where I'm at, so they know
I love my family, Lord, bless my family
Please tell my family I'll be home soon

I'm on Flight 92, stuck on this runway (Yeah)
Waitin' for a storm to pass before we take (Yeah)
Off, I just wanna get home, Lord (Yeah)
I'm gettin' no signal on my cellular phone
(This is your captain speaking, and we are clear to take off....)Embed
