Face of the Earth/Chuck @ Artist Development Lyrics
(Face of the earth)

It's been a long time coming since I saw your face
Since we held it down, since we were in the chase
It was the road less traveled, the path less formed
A skinny trail, it was barely worn
But we kept walkin' and slippin' and talking'
And runnin' and fallin' and cryin' and crawlin'
We were in the trenches, on top of the world
Young refugees, but we were momma's pearls
Where you been dog?
Where you been?

I thought you fell off the face of the earth
(I thought you fell, I thought you fell)
I thought you fell off the face of the earth
(I thought you fell off, I thought you fell off)

It's been way too long and we've come too far
For you to drop out of my life like a falling star
Right off my radar, not a sign or a trace
You know I had love for you that's bigger than mistakes
Now Hope Road is calling, let's pack you up and move...
'Cause real friends are willing to intrude
So I'ma push you in 'cause I wanna love you well
Let the ghosts of your past rest

I thought you fell off the face of the earth
(I thought you fell, I thought you fell)
I thought you fell off the face of the earth
(I thought you fell off, I thought you fell off)
I thought you fell off the face of the earth

Open up the door
This is the first day of the rest of your life
What are you waiting for?
This is the first day of the rest of your life

Ooh, I thought you fell off the face of the earth
(I thought you fell, I thought you fell)
I thought you fell off the face of the earth
(I thought you fell off, I thought you fell off)

Open up the door (open up the door)
This is the first day of the rest of your life
(I thought you fell off)
What are you waiting for?
This is the first day of the rest of your life
(I thought you fell off)
Open up the door
Open up the door to life
Open up the door, what are you waiting for?
Open up the door to life

Behold, I stand at the door and knock
If anyone hears My voice and opens the door
I will come in...

** This ain't no ordinary, this ain't no ordinary love...
*(chuckles)* This is ground-breaking...

EMI Artist Development, Chuck speakin'... Yeah...

**
No, please, don't change anything... No, don't add paint to a masterpiece. Hey, look, can I give you a call back? I can't hear you with the freaks next door...
**
Hey, guys...
(Yo, wassup?) (Hey, man)
Sorry to interrupt ya...
(It's cool)
You the new A&R guy?
(Yeah, I am, listenin' to this new tobyMac song, uh, "Boomin'")
Huh, ya think? Hey, can you just turn it down a little bit?
That'd be great...Embed
