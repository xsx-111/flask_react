Suddenly Lyrics
Do-do, do, do-do
Do-do, do, do-do
Do-do, do, do-do

She blew everything to pieces
He’s there hangin' onto Jesus
She broke everything about him down
He said he never saw it comin'
Until the day she dropped the bomb, and
She broke everything about him down

Sometimes there’s nothing left but to believe

And suddenly, all of it’s behind you
And I’m here to remind you
That yesterday is gone, so say goodbye
And suddenly, the skies open above you
And someone really loves you
Now everything’s alive
Everything’s alive
Do-do, do, do-do
Do-do, do, do-do
Do-do, do, do-do

She’s there broken into pieces
But he swears he doesn’t really see it
When she says that all of it was so unfair
But Hope Road is just around the corner
It’s one place there’s never been a foreigner
‘Cause God’s love makes everybody welcome there

Sometimes there’s nothing left but to believe

And suddenly, all of it’s behind you
And I’m here to remind you
That yesterday is gone, so say goodbye
And suddenly, the skies open above you
You know Jesus really loves you
Now everything’s alive
Everything’s alive
Do-do, do, do-do
Do-do, do, do-do
Do-do, do, do-do

Sometimes it’s in an instant
Sometimes we wait for years
But it comes down to the moment
When faith eclipses fear
Your wandering is over
The other side is real
You’ve broken through, your mountain moved
And mercy is revealed
His mercy is revealed, yeah
Yesterday is long gone

And suddenly, all of it’s behind you
And I’m here to remind you
That yesterday is gone so say goodbye
And finally, the skies open around you
And love has truly found you
Now everything is alive
Everything’s alive
Do-do, do, do-do
Do-do, do, do-do (Everything's alive)
Do-do, do, do-do
(Everything's alive)
Do-do, do, do-do (You know, you know)
Do-do, do, do-do (Everything's alive)
Do-do, do, do-do

(Hope Road is just around the corner)
(Hope Road is just around the corner)
(Just around the corner)
Sometimes there’s nothing left but to believeEmbed
