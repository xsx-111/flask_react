Made to Love Lyrics
The dream is fading, now I'm staring at the door
I know it's over 'cause my feet have hit the cold floor
Check my reflection, I ain't feelin' what I see
It's no mystery (Mystery, mystery)
Whatever happened to a passion I could live for?
What became of the flame that made me feel more?
And when did I forget

That I was made to love You
I was made to find You
I was made just for You
Made to adore You
I was made to love
And be loved by You
You were here before me
You were waiting on me
And You said You'd keep me
Never would You leave me
I was made to love
And be loved by You (Loved by You)

The dream's alive with my eyes opened wide
Back in the ring, You've got me swinging for the grand prize
I feel the haters spittin' vapors on my dreams
But I still believe
I'm reachin' out, reachin' up, reachin' over
I feel a breeze cover me called Jehovah
And, Daddy, I'm on my way
'Cause I was made to love

I was made to love You
I was made to find You
I was made just for You
Made to adore You
I was made to love
And be loved by You
You were here before me
You were waiting on me
And You said You'd keep me
Never would You leave me
I was made to love
And be loved by You
I was made to love You
I was made just for You
Made to adore You
I was made to love (I was made to love)
And be loved by You (Loved by You)
You were here before me
You were waiting on me
And You said You'd keep me
Never would You leave me
I was made to love (I was made to love)
And be loved by You (I'm loved by You)

(Na-na-na-na, Na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na, Na-na-na-na-na)
Anything I would give up for You (Na-na-na-na-na)
Everything, I'd give it all away (Na-na-na-na-na)
Anything I would give up for You (Na-na-na-na-na)
Everything, I'd give it all away (Na-na-na-na-na)
Anything I would give up for You (Na-na-na-na-na)
Everything, I'd give it, I'd give it all away
Oh yeah

'Cause I was made to love You
(I was made to love You)
Yeah, I was made to love You
(I was made to find You)
'Cause I was made to love You
(I was made to adore You, made just for You) (Na-na-na-na-na)
I was made to love You
(I was made to adore You, made just for You) (Na-na-na-na-na)
'Cause I was made to love You
(I was made to adore You, made just for You) (Na-na-na-na-na)
I was made to love You (I was made to adore You)
Yeah I'm loved by You
Yeah I'm loved by You (Na-na-na-na-na)
Yeah I'm loved by You (Na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na)
