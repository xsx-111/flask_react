One World Lyrics
(All right, this time it's for real)
One time, one world
Two times, one love
Three times, rewind
'Cause I'ma dedicate this song to every one of God's children
(Woo-hoo) (Ah-ha)
(Woo-hoo) (Oh yeah)
(Woo-hoo) (Ah-ha)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo) (Yeah, y'all-y'all-y'all)

Come as you are, come just like you be (What)
It's the bumps and curves of our history (No)
But no blocks in the road that we can't traverse
And no wounds from the past that can't be nursed, uh
All hate gonna dissipate from our fate
No check, together we got a checkmate
All hate gonna dissipate and fade away
To make room for a brand new day, we got

One world 'til it's time to fly, so it's (Time to fly)
One love 'til we say goodbye, we got (Say goodbye)
One world, it's enough to share 'til we're (Uh)
Called home and we’re caught up in the air, we got
One world
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
One world
Together we can be perfect harmony
One world (Woo)
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
One world
And I'ma dedicate this song to every one of God's children

(Woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo)
Hey-hey-hey, hey, hey-hey

One world oughta be more than enough
And if it's not, is God looking in pure disgust?
Wondering what the dilly with the silly I see?
When I made each of these in the image of me, uh-huh-huh
Every day is a chance for a new stance
Like every song is the beginning of a new dance
And every one of us was made to reflect the light
And glorify the Most High so bright, we got
One world 'til it's time to fly, so it's (Ah-ha)
One love 'til we say goodbye, we got (Say goodbye)
One world, it's enough to share
'Til the King calls us home and we’re caught up in the air, we got

One world
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
One world
Together we can be perfect harmony
One world (Woo)
I'll look out for you, you look out for me
One world
And I'ma dedicate this song to everyone of God's children

(Woo-hoo) (Ah-ha)
(Woo-hoo) (Oh yeah)
(Woo-hoo) (Ah-ha)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

You can come as you are (Come on)
Love is yours, love is ours ('Cause I)
I am a witness to sweet forgiveness
You will shine like a star (Like a star, baby)
Burning bright where you are
In our one world
One world
(...like a star, like a star, like a star, like a star... baby)
One world
(Like a star, baby)
One world (Woo)
And I'ma dedicate this song, dedicate this song (Woo-hoo)

One world (One world)
I'll look out for you, you look out for me (Woo-hoo)
One world (One world)
Together we can be perfect harmony (Woo-hoo)
One world (One world)
I'll look out for you, you look out for me (Woo-hoo)
One world (One world)
And I'ma dedicate this song, dedicate this song

(Woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

Let's come together in love
(I'll look out for you, you look out for me)
Let's come together in love
(Together we can be perfect harmony) (Come on)
Let's come together in love
(I'll look out for you, you look out for me) (Come on)
Let's come together in love (Uh)
Come togetherEmbed
