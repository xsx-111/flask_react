A Lovely Night Lyrics
The sun is nearly gone
The lights are turning on
A silver shine that stretches to the sea
We've stumbled on a view
That's tailor-made for two
What a shame those two are you and me
Some other girl and guy
Would love this swirling sky
But there's only you and I
And we've got no shot
This could never be
You're not the type for me

Really?

And there's not a spark in sight
What a waste of a lovely night

You say there's nothing here?
Well, let's make something clear
I think I'll be the one to make that call
But you'll call?

And though you looked so cute
In your polyester suit

It's wool

You're right, I'd never fall for you at all
And maybe this appeals
To someone not in heels
Or to any girl who feels
There's some chance for romance
(whistling)

But, I'm frankly feeling nothing

Is that so?
Or it could be less than nothing

Good to know
So you agree?

That's right

What a waste of a lovely night13Embed
