Another Day of Sun Lyrics
Ba-ba-da-ba da-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba ba-da-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba ba
I think about that day
I left him at a Greyhound station
West of Santa FÃ©
We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
Still I did what I had to do
'Cause I just knew
Summer; Sunday nights
We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights
A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
It called me to be on that screen
And live inside each scene

Without a nickel to my name
Hopped a bus, here I came
Could be brave or just insane

We'll have to see
'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
He'll sit one day, the lights are down
He'll see my face and think of how he...

...used to know me

Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

I hear 'em ev'ry day
The rhythms in the canyons
That'll never fade away
The ballads in the barrooms
Left by those who came before
They say "you gotta want it more"
So I bang on ev'ry door
And even when the answer's "no"
Or when my money's running low
The dusty mic and neon glow
Are all I need

And someday as I sing my song
A small-town kid'll come along

That'll be the thing to push him on and go go

Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun


And when they let you down
The morning rolls around
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Just another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Another day has just begun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun20Embed
