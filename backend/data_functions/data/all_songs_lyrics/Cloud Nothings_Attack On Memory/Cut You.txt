Cut You Lyrics
Does he hurt you like I do?
Does he even hit you too?

Is he gonna work out?
Is he gonna work out?

Can he be as mean as me?
Can he cut you in your sleep?

Is he gonna work out?
Is he gonna work out?

I need to know
I deserve to know
I need to know
I deserve to know

Do you feel safe with him?
Can he give you everything?
Is he gonna work out?
Is he gonna work out?

Do you wanna hurt him?
Do you wanna kill him?

Is he gonna work out?
Is he gonna work out?

I need to know
I deserve to know
I need to know
I deserve to know

I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt

I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt
I miss you cause I like damage
I need something I can hurt2Embed
