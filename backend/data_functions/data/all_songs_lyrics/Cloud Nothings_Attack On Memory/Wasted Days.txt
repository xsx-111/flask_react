Wasted Days LyricsWell, I know my life's not gonna change
And I live through all these wasted days
Never thought that I'd end up this way
And I know it's gonna stay the same
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
And I know I'm losing all my time
Doesn't seem like it was ever mine
Feeling sick, but I don't know why
Getting tired of living 'til I die
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this
I thought I would be more than this4Embed
