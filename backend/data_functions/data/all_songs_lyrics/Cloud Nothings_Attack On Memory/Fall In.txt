Fall In Lyrics
Fall in, fall in, fall in
Fall in, fall in, fall in
Fall in, fall in, fall in
Fall in, fall in, fall in
Permission to behave
You know you’re not the same
You wait for days and days
For me to say your name
I want to be like you
I think you know the truth
I want to be like you
Show me what I should do
Nothing left for you to use
Nothing left for you to use
Nothing left for you to use
Nothing left

Fall in, fall in, fall in
Fall in, fall in, fall in
Fall in, fall in, fall in
Fall in, fall in, fall in
It’s such an awful game
They want to play with me
They walk into the shade
Try to escape the blame
They don’t believe in me
Why should I agree
They don’t believe in me
I should cooperate
Nothing left for you to use
Nothing left for you to use
Nothing left for you to use
Nothing left

Fall in, fall in
Fall in, fall inEmbed
