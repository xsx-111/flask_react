Stay Useless Lyrics
Can I see, what's going wrong with me?
I used to have it all, now I'm alone
I'd never say, I'm better off this way
I need something to do, somewhere to go

I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time

How can I feel, so utterly unreal?
Like nothing I could do, would make things change
I'm stuck in here, and I'm tired of everywhere
I'm never gonna learn, to be alone

I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time to stop moving, I need time to stay useless
I need time1Embed
