Pilate Lyrics
Talk of circles and punching out
Looking in, drawing circles down
Falling up the south marking ground
Talking out of turn, drawing circles down

Like Pilate, I have a dog
Like Pilate, I have a dog

Walks me out of town
Still, one's a crowd
Making angels in the dirt
Looking up, looking all around

Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)

Stunned by my own reflection
It's looking back, sees me too clearly
And I swore I'd never go there again
Not unlike a friend that politely drags you down, you down, you down...
Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dog
(Obeys, listens, kisses, loves)
Like Pilate, I have a dogEmbed
