Push Me, Pull Me Lyrics
"If reality is what I see..."

I had a false belief
I thought I came here to stay
We're all just visiting
All just breaking like waves
The oceans made me, but who came up with love?

Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out
Push me, pull me, or pull me out
Push me, pull me, or pull me out

So if there were no angels, would there be no sin?
You better stop me before I begin, but let me say:
If I behave, can you arrange a spacious hole in the ground?
Somewhere nice, make it nice
Where the land meets high tide

Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out
Push me, pull me, or pull me out
Push me, pull me, or pull me out
Push me, pull me, or pull me out
Like a cloud dropping rain
I'm discarding all thought
I'll dry up, leaving puddles on the ground
I'm like an opening band for the sun

Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out
Push me, pull me, or pull me out
Push me, pull me, or pull me out
Push me, pull me, or pull me outEmbed
