Sit This One Out Lyrics
The night's getting old and your eyes are weary
You can't see clearly and your nerves are thinning
A half-eaten meal and a tear on the table
But don't seem able to hold the anger in

Love sometimes takes the form of frustration
It's a sad combination of emptiness and doubt
But only a human connection is expressed with a shout
Well, I think I'm gonna have to just sit this one out

There was a time
When we could sit and talk about things together
No, we didn't shout about things, at all
We laughed, we loved, we played
We said what we had to say
But there's nothing to do now
And I don't have a clue how rise above it all

Love sometimes takes the form of frustration
It's a sad combination of emptiness and doubt
But only a human connection is expressed with a shout
Well, I think I'm gonna have to just sit this one out
Well, I know you understand what I'm talking about
Love sometimes takes on the form of frustration
A sad combination of emptiness and doubt
But only a human connection is expressed with a shout
Cut down and run
I think I'm gonna have to sit down and sit this one out?
Let me say it again: I think I'm gonna have to just sit this one out

Can I ride above it all? I didn't even have a clue
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna to fall
Something said "Hold on, don't let go"
Don't give up of everything that you work for, so long
Don't destroy your self in a second with anger
Hold on, a change will come
I just wanna say: I think I'm gonna have to sit and work this one out1Embed
