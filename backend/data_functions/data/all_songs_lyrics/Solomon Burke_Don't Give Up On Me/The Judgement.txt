The Judgement Lyrics
The accused will rise
To be torn in two
Guilty of nothin' but loving you
This is the judgement
And I'm willin' to plead
How you don't want me
Hopin' this torment will cease
Will I be released?
There'll be lies, there'll be tears
A jury of your peers
With a pitiful look of experience
Hand down the judgement
And if I done wrong
And loved you too long
Stand up and just testify
How can you deny?
Objection overruled
I wait for my reprieve
With the trust of the deceived
The wisdom of the fool
It's his sorrowful face
Too heavy for his head
'Cause he bowed it as something come over him
It was the judgement
And he falls to his knees
Have mercy on me
He clings to the hem of her gown
She says "Just take him down"
Just take him down
Just take him downEmbed
