The Other Side of the Coin Lyrics
Well if I'd done all the things folks say I've done
I'd be in the ground or somewhere on the run
Take a look before you close the book
Look at the other side of the coin

Yes there's much in life for which I could atone
But let him without sin cast the first stone
But before you do there's still one more point of view
On the other side of the coin

I'm just a man, sometimes foolish and proud
But all too quick sometimes to really play up to the crowd
But before you judge me, if judge you must
Take your time, be sure that the verdict is just
Before you do there's one point of view
Can you stand up and say justice has been done today
Oh I was wrong, so wrong before you see what's going on
The other side of the coin

Yes there's much for which in life I should atone
But let them without sin get up and cast the first stone
And before you do remember there's still one more point of view
On the other side of the coin
On the other side of the coin
Oh yeahEmbed
