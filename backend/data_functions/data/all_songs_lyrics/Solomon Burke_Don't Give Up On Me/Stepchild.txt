Stepchild LyricsWell I crawled across the desert for you, baby
And you said, 'So what?'
I bring you diamonds from the diamond mine
Find your door shut
You treat me like a stepchild
Ooh, I am your stepchild
Sometimes I wanna turn and run away
But my heart just won't let me be
You treat me like a stepchild
What's a matter with you, baby?
Have you lost your point of view?
Don't you want no one person
Taking advantage of you?
You treat me like a stepchild
Sure enough treat me like a stepchild
Sometimes I wanna turn and run away
But my heart says, 'Stay'
You treat mе like a stepchild
I work hard evеry day and every night for you
And I don't even cry
I do everything you want me to do
And I don't even try
You treat me like a stepchild
Whoa, you treat me like a stepchild
Anything you ask me, you know I'm willing
I just sure can't beat Bob Dylan
But you still treat me like a stepchild
Come on!
You make me moan, you make me cry
You make me laugh full of joy
Sometimes you make me feel like
A brand new baby boy
But then you treat me like a stepchild
I don't know why you do that to me
But you treat me - you treat me like a stepchild
Well when you're 'round all your other friends
You won't let me in
You's treat me - you's treat me like a stepchild
I work hard for you, baby, every night
Come home and treat you right
You wanna stay out and listen to ol' Bob Dylan play all night
You treat me like a stepchild
Why you wanna treat me like a stepchild?
Well you're wearing out your shoes
Dancing to the blues
And you treat me like a stepchild
Here we go now!
Well I crawled across the desert
Just for you, baby
And you said, 'So what?'
You just wouldn't behave
You treat me like a stepchild
You treat me just like a stepchild
Sometimes I wanna turn and run away
But my heart says, 'Stay...
Stay, stepchild'
I'm your stepchildEmbed
