Only a Dream LyricsOnly a dream that I had in the night
Only a dream but it felt so right
Well, I was down there in the moonlight
I was holding you tight
But it was only a dream, only a dream
Only a dream that knocks me off my feet
Only a dream have you dancing in the street
And that big band keeps on playing Joe Henry's retreat
But only a dream, only in my dream
Only a dream that somebody tried to knock me down
Only a dream keeps on hanging around
And around and around
Only a dream, we're rolling, rolling in the snow
Only a dream, we just couldn't let go
I sit outside your window just like Romeo
But it's only a dream. Yes, only a dream
But someone tries to knock me down to the ground
But it was only a dream
But it's just a dream
Still hanging around, Still hanging around
Hanging aroundEmbed
