Fast Train Lyrics
1, 2, 3...

Well you've been on a fast train and it's going off the rail
And you can't come back, can't come back again
And you start breaking down in the cold rain
Oh you've been on a fast train, on a fast train
And your lover has gone away
Don't it make you feel sad?
Then you go on a journey way into the land
Then you start breaking down
'Cause you're under strain
And you jumping on
Yes you're jumping on a fast train
Jumping on a fast train

Gotta go on a lam, stuck in no-man's land
Ain't nobody here on your waveband
Ain't nobody gonna lend you a helping hand
And you start breaking down
Then you go into the sound
What you hear that fast train
Ooh! Fast train
(Fast train)
Then you keep on moving on to the sound of the wheels
Oh, deep down in your heart, do you really know how you feel?
Then you start breaking down, go into the pain
Keep on moving on a fast train, moving on a fast train
Well, way over the land
Next thing you're out of your mind
And you're out of your depth
And through the window, she crept
Oh there's nowhere to go in the sleet and snow
Just keep on moving, move on a fast train
Moving on a fast train

You gotta go on a lam you stuck in no-man's land
Ain't nobody on your waveband
Gonna lend you a helping hand
And you're all alone
Can you really make it on your own?
Keep on moving on a fast train
Oh you're going nowhere fast

How long can it last? (Keep on moving)
Ooh on a fast train (Keep on moving)
Keep on, keep on moving (Keep on moving)
Keep on moving on a fast train (Keep on moving)
Going to the desert and the barren of sand (Keep on moving)
Through all of the worst and the bush wasteland
(Keep on moving)
Keep on moving (Keep on moving)
Across the desert and sands (Keep on moving)
Through the barren wasteland (Keep on moving)
Moving kinda fast, on a fast train (Keep on moving)
Moving kinda fa-fa-fa-fast, keep on a fast train (Keep on moving)
Going nowhere fast on Montana land (Keep on moving)
So the fast train, hook on your, your moving on a fast train
(Keep on moving)
Moving on a fast train (Keep on moving)
Going nowhere fast (Keep on moving)
Somebody lend a helping hand, I can't understand
(Keep on moving)
Going through this wasted land
I'm a crazy man (Keep on moving on a fast train)
No, happy on a fast train (Keep on moving)
Fa-fa-fa-fast train (Keep on moving)
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fast train (Keep on moving)
On a fast train
Going nowhere, Ooh!Embed
