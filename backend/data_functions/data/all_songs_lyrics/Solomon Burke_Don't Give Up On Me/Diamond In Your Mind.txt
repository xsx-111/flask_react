Diamond In Your Mind Lyrics
I shook the hand of the president and the pope in Rome
I've been to parties where I've had to be flown
They said everything was sacred, nothing was profane
And money was something that you throw off the back of trains

Oh always keep a diamond in your mind
You've got to always keep a diamond in your mind
Wherever you may wander
Wherever you may roam
You've got to always keep a diamond in your mind

Steam of the gravy with little fried pearls
Floating like a necklace on a beautiful girl
Johnna says thanks to the food and land
And oh so ever grateful for God's on my hands

Oh always keep a diamond in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mind
Wherever you may wander
Wherever you may roam
You've got to always keep a diamond in your mind
She's got the milk of human kindness and the fat of the lamb
Scared like a baby, well she drives like a man
She lives outside of Natchez where she operates a crane
She's like a wrecking ball no longer connected to the chain
Oh Zerelda Samuel said she almost never prayed
Said she lost her right arm, blown off in a Pinkerton raid
Then they lashed her to a windmill with old 3-fingered Dave
Now she's a hundred-and-two drinking mint juleps in the shade

Everybody...
Always keep a diamond in your mind
You've got to always keep a diamond in your mind
Wherever you may wander
Wherever you may roam
You've got to always keep a diamond in your mind
Would you help me sing it, come on
Always keep a diamond in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mind (Wherever you may wander)
Wherever you may wander
Wherever you may roam
Your gotta always keep a diamond in your mind
One more time, come on...
Always keep a diamond in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mind
Wherever you may wander
Wherever you may roam
Your gotta always keep a diamond in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mindEmbed
