Great Divide Lyrics
Oh darling, I’ve been waiting
All this time, contemplating
On the other side of the great
The great divide

Oh darling, I’ve been yearning
All the lonely nights, my heart’s been burning
Because I’m on the other side of the great
The great divide

I know you’re out there
Somewhere waiting for me
Just like I’m waiting for you, you

Oh darling, I’ve been waiting
All this time, contemplating
On the other side of the great
Of thе great divide

I’ll be hеre waiting
Here on the other side
Of the great divideEmbed
