Whatever You Want Lyrics
Well, I know it wasn’t love
But I was told it would be enough
Yeah I thought I would be alright
But I’m not gonna stay and fight

With the good old boys
‘Cause good old boys
Will have you begging and pleading

Whatever you want, baby
Whatever you need maybe
Whatever you want I can’t give
No, I can’t give you
Anything more, baby
Those days are gone forever
When I gave you whatever you want

Well, I knew you weren’t the one
But I was hoping you would lift me up
So I stayed in my lonely room
So afraid of what you might do
Now I’ve made my choice
No morе good old boys
They’ll get you begging and plеading

Whatever you want, baby
Whatever you need maybe
Whatever you want I can’t give
No I can’t give you
Anything more, baby
Those days are gone forever
When I gave you

Gave you all I am
And know that
You don’t give a damn

Now I’ve made my choice
No more good old boys
Now I’ve made my choice
No more good old boys

Whatever you want, baby
Is too much for me maybe
Whatever you want I can’t give
No, I can’t give you
Anything more, baby
Those days are gone forever
When I gave you whatever you want
Hey, hey, hey
When I gave you whatever you wantEmbed
