Diamond Studded Shoes Lyrics
Everybody's saying that it's gonna be alright
But I can't help but wonder
If it's gonna be on my dime
We are the poor ones
Rowing up against the tide
Burning our reserves of courage
And working just to make it alright
When we know it isn't

We know it isn't, we know it isn't
We know it isn't, it ain't gonna turn out right
We know it isn't, we know it isn't, oh no
We know it isn't, that's why we gots to fight

You and I are trying
But we don't get to decide
When the man comes for our paychecks
Don't you tell me it'll be alright
We aren't the rich ones
Some of us'll barely get by
They buy diamond studded shoes with our taxes
Anything to keep us divided, you know it isn't
We know it isn't, we know it isn't
We know it isn't, it ain't gonna turn out right
We know it isn't, we know it isn't, oh no
We know it isn't, that's why we gots to
Fight, for the life and soul of the world we know
Fight, 'cause the promise is never gonna be enough

Watching and waiting for answers
Hoping we might see the light
You beat it into us like a hammer
So don't you tell me it's gonna be alright
When we know it isn't

We know it isn't, we know it isn't
We know it isn't, it ain't gonna turn out right
We know it isn't, we know it isn't, oh no
We know it isn't, that's why we gots to
Fight, for the life and soul of the world we know
Fight, 'cause the promise is never gonna be enough

Oh yeah, oh yeah
You know it
You know it
Ah ha yeah you know it2Embed
