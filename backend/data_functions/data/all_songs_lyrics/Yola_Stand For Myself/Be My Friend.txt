Be My Friend Lyrics
No thanks will come
No thanks will come your way
When you’re living in the center
Of a circle made to break

Until you find the one that always knew your name
Someone who loves you even if they feel your pain
Will be there for you

Won’t you be my friend
Out in the rain?
Won’t you be my friend
Out on a rainy day?

No medal will adorn you
No fanfare will salute your fame
Even if you’re always smiling
Like you mean no harm or shade

Hoping someone remembers, nobody knows your name
The fires turn to ember but the memory remains
That you love me
Won’t you be my friend
Out in the rain?
Won’t you be my friend
Out on a rainy day?

Hoping when they go and say our children’s names
Hoping that humanity will save them from the grave
And so I ask you

Won’t you be my friend
Out in the rain?
Won’t you be my friend
Out on a rainy day?

Won’t you be my friend
Out in the rain?
Won’t you be my friend
Out on a rainy day?Embed
