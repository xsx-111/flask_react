Barely Alive Lyrics
I been here and I know how it is
I been living it alone for all these years
Isolated, we hold in our tears
And we try to get by
And we strive, but we’re barely alive

I been there and I know how it feels
Take your time as you learn how to deal
Isolated, we hold in our fears
And we try to get by
And we strive, but we’re barely alive

When will we start living? (Start living)
Could you even try? (Even try)
When will you start living (Start living)
Now that you’ve survived? (That you’ve survived)

Who can tell how long we’ll feel this pain?
Is it here for a spell or will it always remain?
Isolated, getting hard to maintain
But we try to get by
And we strive, but we’re barely alive
When will we start living? (Start living)
Could you even try? (Even try)
When will you start living (Start living)
Now that you’ve survived? (That you’ve survived)

How can you start living, oh when? (Start living)
Tell me, what will you do with your life?
Ooh baby, yeah
(Start living)
They didn’t take your lifeEmbed
