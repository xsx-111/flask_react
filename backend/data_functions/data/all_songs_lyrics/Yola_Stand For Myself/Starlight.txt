Starlight Lyrics
I've been trying to hide it
Trying hard to deny it
I've been thinking 'bout how it's gonna go down
Go down

Spent a lifetime without it
Trying hard not to even think about it
I listen alone but I don't hear a sound (A sound)
A sound (A sound)

Because in my mind I'm seeing starlight
One more time for my imagination
I'm not high, don't let me be misunderstood

I've been thinkin' 'bout your kissin'
Lord knows what I've been missin'
You're the only one who could put me in such a state
A state

Never take your love for granted
I'll be waiting on you just like we planned it
Taking your time, I'll sip my wine while I wait (While I wait)
Don't bе late (Don't be late)
Bеcause in my mind I'm seeing starlight
One more time for my imagination
I'm not high, don't let me be misunderstood
Like we should

I've been trying to hide it
Trying hard to deny it
I've been thinking 'bout how it's gonna go down
Go down

Because in my mind I'm seeing starlight
One more time for my imagination
I'm not high, don't let me be misunderstood

Because in my mind we are together
All the time, even the cloudy weather
Ain't no crime, sometimes we just wanna feel good
Like we should
Like we shouldEmbed
