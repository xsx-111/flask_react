If I Had To Do It All Again Lyrics
If I had to do it all again
I wouldn’t wanna do it, do it without you
If you had to be somebody’s friend
You wouldn’t wanna do it, do it without me
No, no

I thought that I could hold a candle all alone
But without your love, I couldn’t see a way
Thought that I could play the hero on my own
But without you, I just don’t know who to save

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn’t wanna do it, do it without you
If you had to be somebody’s friend
You wouldn’t wanna be, be it without me
No, no

It’s a long and lonely highway by yourself
You could drive all night and never get too far
You went and did it your way, no one else
But you only put the miles upon your heart
If I had to do it all again
I wouldn’t wanna do it, do it without you
If you had to be somebody’s friend
You wouldn’t wanna be, be it without me
No

You and I
We didn’t always get along, oh no
Instead of goodbye
Why don’t we get on back where we both belong, oh

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn’t wanna do it, do it without you
If you had to be somebody’s friend
You wouldn’t wanna be, be it without me

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn’t wanna do it, do it without you
If you had to be somebody’s friend
You wouldn’t wanna be, be it without me
No, oh no
No, oh
I know, I know
Oh, oh
I say oh no
I say oh noEmbed
