Like a Photograph Lyrics
Whoever said life was like a river
That was gonna roll on forever
Had to have been
Out of their mind

If I ever waste another minute
Simply for refusing to be in it
Show me back in
Rain or come shine

Tell me softly that you’d love to lay by my side
No delay just in case we run out of time

Hold me close just like a photograph
Hoping it will last
Soon enough it’s gonna be the past
It’s coming fast


All I want is you to hear the sound of my voice
Once you hear me I fear you’ll be left with no choice
Won’t you hold me close just like a photograph
Hoping it will last
Because soon enough it’s gonna be the past
It’s coming fast

Whoever said life was like a river
That was gonna roll on forever
Whoever said life was like a river
That was gonna roll on forever
Whoever said life was like a river
That was gonna roll on forever
Whoever said life was like a river
That was gonna roll on forever
Whoever said life was like a river
That was gonna roll on forever
Whoever said life was like a river
That was gonna roll on foreverEmbed
