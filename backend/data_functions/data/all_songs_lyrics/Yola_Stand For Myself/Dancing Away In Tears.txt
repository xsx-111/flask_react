Dancing Away In Tears Lyrics
We’re dancing away in tears
The music we make disappears

Breaking up is always hard to do
One last dance is all I want with you
I can’t go and do it all again
And pretend that I ever wanted to

We’re dancing away in tears
The music we make disappears

The party is over now, we’re on the floor
You’re not mine and baby I’m not yours
I can’t go and do it all again
And pretend that we were never something more

Goodbye baby, goodbye love
I wish you well, well enough
Oh, goodbye baby, goodbye love
It was good, now it’s gone
Breaking up is always hard to do
One last dance is all I want with you
I can’t go and do it all again
And pretend that I ever wanted to

Breaking up is always hard to do
One last dance is all I want with you
I can’t go and do it all again
And pretend that I ever wanted to

Goodbye baby, goodbye love
I wish you well, well enough
Oh, goodbye baby, goodbye love
I wish you well, well enough
Oh, goodbye baby, goodbye love
I wish you well, well enoughEmbed
