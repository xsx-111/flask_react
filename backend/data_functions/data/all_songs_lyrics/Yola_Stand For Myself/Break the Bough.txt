Break the Bough Lyrics
Silently break the bough
Fall into the deepest sleep
Dream of mangoes on the tree
Sugar cane and shoeless feet
Silently break the bough
Forget every distant memory
Every foe you dreamed to kill
Every emotion you never let spill

See with eyes unclouded
Feel with arms unbound
You’re free to fly
You’re free my love, my heart
You’re free

Silently free the soul
Oh, let it be released
Lеt it spread and find a home
And maybe thеn you will find peace
What a hurricane in a hole
What a story to be told
What a heart finally unchained
Get on back from whence you came
See with eyes unclouded
Feel with arms unbound
You’re free to fly
You’re free my love, my heart
You’re free, oh

Now I don’t know what I’ve lost
And I don’t know what I miss
I’ve lived without your love for so long
I sometimes wonder if I even exist
Hey, hey, hey!

Silently break the bough
Fall into the deepest sleep
Dream of mangoes on the tree
Sugar cane and shoeless feet
Silently break the bough
Fall into the deepest sleep
Dream of mangoes on the tree
Sugar cane and shoeless feet

See with eyes unclouded
Feel with arms unbound
You’re free to fly
You’re free my love, my heart
You’re free, oh
You’re free, Mama
Hey, hey, hey
You’re free, Mama
Oh, oh, oh
You’re free, Mama
Oh, you’re free nowEmbed
