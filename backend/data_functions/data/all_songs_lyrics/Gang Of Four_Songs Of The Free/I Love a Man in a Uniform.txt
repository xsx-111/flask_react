I Love a Man in a Uniform Lyrics
Time with my girl, I spent it well
I had to be strong for my woman
(You must be joking, oh man, you must be joking!)
She needed to be protected

The good life was so elusive
Handouts, they got me down
I had to regain my self-respect
So I got into camouflage
The girls, they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform!
I love a man in a uniform!
I love a man in a uniform!
I love a man in a uniform!

To have ambitions was my ambition
But I had nothing to show for my dreams
Time with my girl, I spent it well
(You must be joking, oh man, you must be joking!)
The good life was so elusive
Handouts, they got me down
I had to regain my confidence
So I got into camouflage
The girls, they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform!
I love a man in a uniform!
I love a man in a uniform!
I love a man in a uniform!

I need an order! (Shoot! Shoot!)
I need an order! (Shoot! Shoot!)
I need an order! (Shoot! Shoot!)
I need an order! (Shoot! Shoot!)
To have ambition was my ambition
Time with my girl, I spent it well
(You must be joking, oh man, you must be joking!)
The girls, they love to see you shoot
The girls, they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform!
I love a man in a uniform!
(They love to see you shoot!)
I love a man in a uniform!

The girls, they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform!
(They love to see you shoot!)
The girls, they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform!
(They love it, they love it, they love it, they love to see you shoot!)
The girls, they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform!
(They love it, they love it, they love it, they love to see you shoot!)
The girls, they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform!
(They love it, they love it, they love it, they love to see you shoot!)
The girls, they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform!
(They love it, they love it, they love it, they love to see you shoot!)
The girls, they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform!
(They love it, they love itâ€¦)2Embed
