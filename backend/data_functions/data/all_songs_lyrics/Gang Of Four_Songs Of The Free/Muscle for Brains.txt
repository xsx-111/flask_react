Muscle for Brains LyricsDon't help me I can save myself
If I'm incomplete don't fill the gaps
Save me from the people who would save me from myself
They got muscle for brains
For reasons that are not mysterious
The weak are sent to the wall
They have reservations in heaven
Down here they're not so fashionable
Don't help me I can save myself
If I'm incomplete don't fill the gaps
Save me from the people who would save me from my sin
They got muscle for brains
For reasons that are not mysterious
Morality's used as a tool
The poor are told to be contented
But in this life they've no choice at all
Don't help me I can save myself
If I'm incomplete don't fill the gaps
Save me from the people who would save me from myself
They got muscle for brains
For reasons that are not mysterious
The weak are sent to the wall
They have reservations in heaven
Down here they're not so fashionable
Don't help me I can save myself
If I'm incomplete don't fill the gaps
Save me from the people who would save me from myelf
They got muscle for brains
Save me from the people who would save me from my sin
They got muscle for brainsEmbed
