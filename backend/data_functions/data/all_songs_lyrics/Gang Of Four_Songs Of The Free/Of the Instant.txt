Of the Instant LyricsWho owns what you do?
Who owns what you use?
This land is your land
This land is my land
Right now to touch flesh is real
Let us think only of the instant
There was something that I can't remember
Did you say "I've had enough"?
We are in a happy state
It all comes to those who wait
While others plot the fate of nations
We spent the afternoons in an embrace
Somehow, you can't block it out
The bitter taste of interference
We still try to construct the difference
The space between a word and its sense
We, it seems, can own ourselves
In imagination
Then you say, we make our own world
Not everyone takes what they are given
If we believe what we are saying
We have the chance to include ourselves out
Who owns what you do?
Who owns what you use?
Then you say, we make our own world
Not everyone takes what they are given
There was something that I can't remember
Did you say "I've had enough"?
There was something that I can't remember
We have the chance to include ourselves outEmbed
