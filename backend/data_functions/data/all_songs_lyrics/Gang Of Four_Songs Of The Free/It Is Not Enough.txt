It Is Not Enough LyricsIt is not enough
Here we go again
I'd like to see something new
It's all so familiar
I wanted to be a good wife
I wonder if I've lived before this life
Or seen it on television
I can't stand the repetition
It is not enough
It is just a habit
Nostalgia, it's no good
Our future was in the past
(I will be good to you, if you love me true)
(I will be good to you, if you love me true)
Passion, it burns me up
It isn't how I thought it would be
I have to wait for the right moment
It always depends on him
It is not enough
It is just a habit
Nostalgia, it's no good
Our future was in the past
Have I lived before this life?
Have I lived before this life?
Have I lived before this life?
Have I lived before this life?
It is not enough
It is just a habit
Nostalgia, it's no good
Our future was in the past
It is not enough
It is just a habit
Nostalgia, it's no good
Our future was in the past
It is not enough
It is just a habit
It is just a habitEmbed
