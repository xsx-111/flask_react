Electric Fire LyricsAnd then, one magic night
Sitting by the electric fire
Outer space (Outer space)
And all associated regions (And all associated regions)
Including the Aurora Borealis (Including the Aurora Borealis)
And the great thunderstorms from the south
(And the great thunderstorms from the south, the south
The great thunderstorms from the south, the south, the south)
All descended into, became part of, his giant head and mindEmbed
