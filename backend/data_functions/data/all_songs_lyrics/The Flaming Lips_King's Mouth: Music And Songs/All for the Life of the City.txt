All for the Life of the City LyricsHe walks through the streets of the city
Everyone saying hello (Hello, hello, hello, hello)
The king of their hearts in the city
He's the king of all houses and homes
One day the snow got too heavy
Rolling down to the city below (Look out below!)
The mountain and sky couldn't hold it
Would it bury the last rainbow?
The king saves the day (All for the life of the city)
But the king dies today (All for the life of the city)
In a time far away (All for the life of the city)
And the king saves the day (All for the life of the city)
But the king dies today (All for the life of the city)
In a time far away (All for the life of the city)
In the spring, he was found where he was buried
Flowers grew from his toes
The mountain and sky told the story
Of how he held back the avalanche snow
And the king saves the day (And the king saves the day)
But the king dies today (But the king dies today)
In a time far away (In a time far away)
The king dies today
The king dies today
All for the life of the city
In a time far awayEmbed
