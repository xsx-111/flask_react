Feedaloodum Beedle Dot LyricsFeedaloodum beedle dot
I give you all the love I got
Shout it from the mountaintop
Flowing like a lava spot
Feedaloodum beedle dot
Flowing like a lot of snot
Out my nose and down my face
Flowers drooping in a vase
Coming back from outer space
Helping out the human race
Feedaloodum beedle dot
You think it's heavy but it's not
The king is dead
Let's cut off his head
(Yeah, yeah, the king is dead)
The king is dead
Let's cut off his head
(Yeah, yeah, the king is dead)
So yeah it's bad the king is dead
Let's hurry and cut off his head
He was buried in a lot of snow
Colder than fifty below
I think that it preserved his mind
His mind still full of space and time
So yeah it's bad the king is dead
Let's hurry and cut off his head
Feedaloodum beedle dot
You think it's heavy but it's not
Feedaloodum beedle dot
You think it's heavy but it's notEmbed
