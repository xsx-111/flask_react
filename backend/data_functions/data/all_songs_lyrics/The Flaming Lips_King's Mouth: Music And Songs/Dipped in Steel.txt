Dipped in Steel LyricsAnd though they were sad, they acted quickly
And sealed his glorious head to preserve it for all time
His dead mouth slowly opened
It would be frozen, sealed, dipped in steel
Screaming thy last scream
Or breathing thy last breath
Or laughing his last, endless, infinite laughEmbed
