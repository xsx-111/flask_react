Mouth of the King LyricsEven in death, the king seemed to be still alive
Into his giant mouth, come on, climb inside
And see the stars, the storms, the swirls
And other worlds that are still there in his head
Still there in his mind
Some were curious, some didn't care
Some were falling in love, some scared
Oh, boys and girls, remember this
Although I have died, I will always exist
From the time that you smile
And every time that you're kind
I'm there in your mouth
And I'm there in your mind
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
Oh, moms and dads (Moms and dads)
In your ships and cars (In your ships and cars)
Show your children (Show your children)
How they came from the stars (How they came from the stars)
And all they'll need (All they'll need)
And all that they'll want (And all they'll want)
Is got through deeds (Got through deeds)
That are done with love (Done with love)
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
Now everybody knows
Yeah, everybody knows it
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
The mouth of the king
(The mouth of the king)
Inside the king's mouth
They entered into the hope of a future
(The mouth of the king)
That has yet to be lived
Raining down, dream upon dream
(The mouth of the king)
With love from above
Dripping and jumping and falling and puffing
(The mouth of the king)
And pulsing and lovingEmbed
