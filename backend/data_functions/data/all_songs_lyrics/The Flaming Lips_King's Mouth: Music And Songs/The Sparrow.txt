The Sparrow LyricsYesterday, blue sky
I saw a sparrow
I thought maybe it flew away from my sorrow
Why would you go?
You'll never see tomorrow
I’d give it all away, one more day
Has to pay for the sparrow
My sorrows, to be gone tomorrow
For the sparrow
My sorrow, to be gone tomorrow
The newborn king now sleeps in his cradle
His mother's grave is pitched from the shadows
They took the crown, they took the crown
The power's crown
The sun goes down, the sun goes down, the sun goes down
The universe brought you here, yeah it’s true (Yes it's true)
The universe can take you away, too (Yeah)
Though you're gone, if I can listen I can hear you (Hear you)
The door to my heart, always stay open (Open)
Forever stay for the sparrow
My sorrows, to be gone tomorrow
For the sparrow
My sorrow, to be gone tomorrow
TomorrowEmbed
