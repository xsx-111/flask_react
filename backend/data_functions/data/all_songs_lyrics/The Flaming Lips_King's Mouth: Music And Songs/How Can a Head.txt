How Can a Head LyricsHow can a head hold so many things?
All our life, all our love, all the songs it sings
And how can a mouth hold so many things?
All our teeth, all our words, all the songs we sing
The songs that say "Have a beautiful day"
That let you know how much I love you so
How can an eye see so many things?
All the sky that goes so high, the face of human beings
And how can an ear hear so many things?
Children laugh, mothers cry, all the bells will ring
The bells that say "Have a beautiful day"
That let you know how much I love you so
How, how can it hold so much?
How can it hold so much?
And that is the end of our story, byeEmbed
