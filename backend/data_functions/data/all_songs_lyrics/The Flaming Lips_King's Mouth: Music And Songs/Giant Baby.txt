Giant Baby LyricsThe giant newborn grew into a giant little boy
It wasn't easy to find him giant baby toys
He loved outer space and he loved the sky
He would reach up to touch it, but it was too high
You're the biggest baby
Don't know how and don't know why
Something strange when you were born
Has made you giant-size
You're the biggest baby
You're the giant little boy
Life is fun and life is big
And life is full of joy
One night, I saw your face up in the sky
In a cloud across the moon, it made me cry
I could see my mother as she died
In my head and in my hands
In the dirt and in the land
And it made me understand
That life sometimes is sad
You're the biggest baby
Don't know how and don't know why
Why, why, why, why, whyEmbed
