Don't you stop
(You gotta keep on believing)
Trying on
Well, you stepped on a cat
Well, that was just that
There's some things we can't explain
Now your mom and your dad
Don't go thinking you're bad
We will love you forever always, yeah
Don't you stop
(You gotta keep on believing)
And don't you stop
(You gotta keep on believing)
Don't you stop
(You gotta keep on believing)
Trying on
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Eight and nine and ten and eleven
Twelve and thirteen and fourteen
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteenEmbed
