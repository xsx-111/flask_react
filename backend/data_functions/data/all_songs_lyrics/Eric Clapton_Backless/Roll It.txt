Roll It Lyrics
Roll it, rock it, roll it in the socket
Roll, roll it, roll, roll it
Feel it, can you feel it, all night, all right
Oh burn it, rock it, moving in the socket
Yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Going to get you, going to get you
Here it comes, do not try to run
I must love you, going to sock it
Going to roll it, going to rock
Roll, roll it, roll, roll it
Oh lord, rock it, loving in the socket, yeah yeahEmbed
