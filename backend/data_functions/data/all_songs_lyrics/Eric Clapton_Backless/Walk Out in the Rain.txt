Walk Out in the Rain Lyrics
Walk out if it does not feel right
I can tell you are only lying
If you have got something better tonight
Then do not mess up my mind with your crying

Just walk out in the rain
Walk out with your dreams
Walk out of my life if you do not feel right
And catch the next train
Oh, darling, walk out in the rain

I have come from so far away
Just to put a ring on your finger
If you have said all that you have got to say
Then please do not feel the need to linger

Just walk out in the rain
Walk out with your dreams
Walk out of my life if you do not feel right
And catch the next train
Oh, darling, walk out in the rain
It is raining outside of the city
My poor feet have walked till they are sore
If you do not want my love, it is a pity
I guess I cannot see you no more

Just walk out in the rain
Walk out with your dreams
Walk out of my life if you do not feel right
And catch the next train
Oh, darling, walk out in the rainEmbed
