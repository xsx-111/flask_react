Tulsa Time Lyrics
Well, I left Oklahoma
Driving in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was going to Arizona
Maybe on to California
Where people all live so fine
My mama says I am crazy
My baby calls me lazy
But I am going to show them all this time
Because you know I ain't no fool
And I don't need no more damn schooling
I was born to just walk the line

Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Going to set my watch back to it
Because you know that I have been through it
Living on Tulsa Time

So there I was in Hollywood
Thinking I was doing good
Talking on the telephone line
They do not want me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs
My mama says my baby's doing fine
So then I started winking
Then I started thinking
That I really had a flash this time
That I had no business leaving
And nobody would be grieving
You see I am on Tulsa time

Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Going to set my watch back to it
Because you know that I have been through it
Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Going to set my watch back to it
Because you know that I have been through it
Living on Tulsa TimeEmbed
