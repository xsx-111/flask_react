Watch Out for Lucy Lyrics
Now my friend Bill was just a working lad
And he liked to have his fun
He liked to find a girl and get comfortable
When his working day was done
He would spend all his money on a Friday night
Wake up in the morning broke
Oh he had a run in with little Lucy then
Believe me that ain't no joke

Watch out for Lucy though she may look frail
Say excuse me, Lucy, darling, don't you use me
I don't want to land in jail

She started out working in a cafe
Picking money up on the side
She was free and easy, everybody's friend
But she couldn't be satisfied
So in walks Bill with his cash in his hand
His heart upon his sleeve
We tried to warn him about her ways
We never did succeed
Watch out for Lucy though she may look frail
Say excuse me, Lucy, darling, don't you use me
I don't want to land in jail

Well, the trap was sprung for poor old Bill
You should have heard little Lucy sing
"I want a Cadillac car, a beautiful home
And a thousand dollar ring"
They found our hero in the gutter
With a diamond ring and a gun
He done it for the love of Lucy
And ended up on the run

Watch out for Lucy though she may look frail
Say excuse me, Lucy, darling, don't you use me
I don't want to land in jail
Watch out for Lucy though she may look frail
Say excuse me, Lucy, darling, don't you use me
I don't want to land in jailEmbed
