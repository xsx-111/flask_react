Tell Me That You Love Me Lyrics
Tell me that you love me as often as you can
Let me know that I am your one and only man
Give me confirmation with every passing day
A love as sweet as ours will never fade away

Catch me when I'm falling, help me when I'm blue
Don't you realize that I will do the same for you?
Find me when I am lonely, carry me back home
Treat me gently and my heart will never roam

Straighten me out, pull me through
Let me know that I'm still in love with you
Be my woman, be my friend
Stick with me until the very end

Straighten me out, pull me through
Let me know that I'm still in love with you
Be my woman, be my friend
Stick with me until the very end

Tell me that you love me as often as you can
Let me know that I'm your one and only man
Give me confirmation every single day
A love as sweet as ours will never fade away
Tell me that you love me as often as you can
Let me know that I'm your one and only man
Give me confirmation every passing day
A love as sweet as ours will never fade away

Catch me when I'm falling, help me when I'm blue
Don't you realize that I will do the same for you?
Find me when I am lonely, carry me back home
Treat me gently and my heart will never roam1Embed
