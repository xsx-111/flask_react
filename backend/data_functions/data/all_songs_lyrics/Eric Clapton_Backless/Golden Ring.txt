Golden Ring Lyrics
He gave to you a golden ring
It made you happy, it made you sing
And I played for you on my guitar
It did not last long, we did not go far

And though the times have changed
We are rearranged
Will the ties that bind remain the same?

You came around after a while
Everyone said that I made you smile
It all went well, and suddenly then
You heard that he would marry again


Well I know that I have been here before
I have trod on your wings, I have opened the door
If I gave to you a golden ring
Would I make you happy, would I make you sing?
