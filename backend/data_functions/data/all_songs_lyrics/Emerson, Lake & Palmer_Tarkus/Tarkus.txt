Tarkus Lyrics


Has the dawn ever seen your eyes?
Have the days made you so unwise?
Realise, you are

Had you talked to the winds of time
Then you'd know how the waters rhyme
Taste of wine

How can you know where you've been?
In time, you'll see the sign
And realise your sin
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Will you know how the seed is sown?
All your time has been overgrown
Never known

Have you walked on the stones of years?
When you speak, is it you that hears?
Are your ears full? (full)
You can't hear anything at all


The preacher said a prayer
Save every single hair on his head
He's dead...
The minister of hate
Had just arrived too late to be spared
Who cared?
The weaver in the web that he made!

The pilgrim wandered in
Committing every sin that he could
So good...
The cardinal of grief
Was set in the belief he'd be saved
From the grave
The weaver in the web that he made!

The high priest took a blade
To bless the ones that prayed
And all obeyed
The messenger of fear
Is slowly growing, nearer to the time
A sign
The weaver in the web that he made!
A bishop rings a bell
A cloak of darkness fell across the ground
Without a sound!
The silent choir sing
And in their silence
Bring jaded sound
Harmonic ground
The weaver in the web that he made!



Clear the battlefield and let me see
All the profit from our victory
You talk of freedom, starving children fall
Are you deaf when you hear the season's call?

Were you there to watch the earth be scorched?
Did you stand beside the spectral torch?
Know the leaves of sorrow turned their face
Scattered on the ashes of disgrace
Every blade is sharp, the arrows fly
Where the victims of your armies lie
Where the blades of grass and arrows rain
Then there'd be no sorrow, be no pain
