Are You Ready Eddy? Lyrics
Are you ready, Eddy, to turn out rock and roll?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Are you ready, Eddy, ready to rock and roll?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Are you ready, Eddy, to give me some of your soul?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)

Are you ready, Eddy, to pull those faders down?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Are you ready, Eddy, to pull your faders down?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Are you ready, Eddy, to turn your scully around?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Oh sock it to me

Are you ready, Eddy, to turn your faders down?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Are you ready, Eddy, to turn your faders down?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Are you ready, Eddy, to turn that scully round?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)

Well, are you ready, Eddy, to turn your sixteen tracks on?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Are you ready, Eddy, with your sixteen tracks?
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Are you ready, Eddy? A bit of vibing is all it lacks
(Eddy edit, Eddy, Eddy edit)
Well, vibe me Eddy, vibe me all night long
(Vibe me, Eddy, Vibe me, vibe me, Eddy)
Vibe me, Eddy, vibe me all night long
(Vibe me, Eddy, Vibe me, vibe me, Eddy)
While you're vibing me, Eddy, nothing can go wrong
(Vibe me, Eddy, Vibe me, vibe me, Eddy)
