Bitches Crystal Lyrics
Bitches crystal
Knows how you twist all the lines
Fortune teller
Future seller of time

Tortured spirits cry
Fear is in their eyes
Ghostly images die

Witches' potion
Mixed in the ocean of tears
Mystical powers
Emerge from the towers of fear

Tortured spirits cry
Fear is in their eyes
Ghostly images die


Evil learning, people burning
Savage casting, no one lasting
Witchcraft, sadness
Madness, turning their minds

Evil learning, people burning
Savage casting, no one lasting
Witchcraft, sadness
Madness, turning their minds

Ritual killings
That swear in the shillings to be
Heretic priestess
Dwells on the weakness she sees

Tortured spirits cry
Fear is in their eye
Ghostly images dieEmbed
