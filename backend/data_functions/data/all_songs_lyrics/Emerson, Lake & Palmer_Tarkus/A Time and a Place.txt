A Time and a Place Lyrics
There is a place
A time and a space
No one can trace
That no one can trace

Somewhere a hill
Where things are still
Just rain water spill
Just rain water spill

Sleep in a dream
Of butter milk cream
You dance on a beam
Dancing on a beam

Save me from this shallow land
Take me out of temper's hand
Drag me from the burning sand
Show me those that understand

Save me from this shallow land
Take me out of temper's hand
Drag me from this burning sand
Show me those that understand

Rest in a shade
No sound is made
Where silence is played
Sound of silence playedEmbed
