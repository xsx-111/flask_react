The Only Way (Hymn) Lyrics

People are stirred
Moved by the word
Kneel at the shrine
Deceived by the wine
How was the earth conceived?
Infinite space
Is there such a place?
You must believe in the human race

Can you believe
God makes you breathe?
Why did he lose
Six million Jews?


Touched by the wings
Fierce angel brings
Sad winter storm
Grey autumn dawn
Who looks on life itself?
Who lights your way?
Only you can say
How can you just obey?

Don't need the word
Now that you've heard
Don't be afraid
Man is man-made
And when the hour comes
Don't turn away
Face the light of day
And do it your way
It's the only way1Embed
