Woo Lyrics
Woo
Woo, woo, yeah
Woo, woo, yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah

I bet she could never make you cry
â€˜Cause the scars on your heart are still mine
Tell me that she couldn't get this deep
She can almost be the worst of me
Too bad she's just eating off your dreams
Let me know when you're ready to bleed
Baby you just need to send for me

Send for me, send for me
Send for me, send for me

Woo
Woo, woo, yeah
Woo, woo, yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah

I've been thinking 'bout you late at night
I've been thinking only of you
Ain't nothing else to really talk about
Boy show me what you want to do
These days you've been feeling lonely
Yeah I've been feeling lonely too
I'ma fuck it up, won't you show me some
Run it back like you owe me some
Woo
Woo, woo, yeah
(Feel me up, feel me up)
Woo, yeah
(Feel me up, feel me up)
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
(Feeling me, feeling me, feeling me up)

Tell me 'bout your picture-perfect love
Tell me how you think without the drugs
Maybe you just need to send for me
I don't mean to really love ya
I don't mean to even care about ya
I don't mean to really love ya
I don't mean to really care about ya, no more
I don't mean to really care about ya, no more

Send for me, send for me
Send for me, send for me

Woo (feel me up, feel me up)
Woo, woo, yeah (feel me up, feel me up)
Woo, woo, yeah
(Send for me, send for me, send for me)
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Woo (I don't mean to really love ya)
I don't mean to even care about ya
Woo (I don't mean to really love ya)
I don't mean to really care about ya, no more
Woo, woo, yeah
(No more, I don't mean to really care about ya, no more
I don't mean to really care about ya, no more)
Aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah90Embed
