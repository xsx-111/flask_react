Be My Downfall LyricsWell the bus is pulling out
And I guess I'd better go
Before I make a grave mistake and let my feelings show
And twenty miles away
She waits alone for me
But when I try to picture her you're the one I see
And in another situation I could put up a fight
But you will be my downfall tonight
So the night is coming down
Drowning us in blue
And it all points towards the things we know we shouldn't do
And as I look at you
And I fall under your spell
Well, I know I should be thinking of her lying there herself
And when faced with temptation you know a man should stand and fight
But you will be my downfall tonight
Be my downfall
Be my great regret
Be the one girl
That I'll never forget
Be my undoing
Be my slow road to ruin tonight
Well the bus is pulling out
And I'm grounded here with you
And I want to say the sweet things babe I've always wanted to
So tell me now the tail-lights have gone out of sight
Baby won't you be my downfall once again tonightEmbed
