Behind the Fool LyricsDon't tell her that you want her
Don't ask her to be yours
Don't tell her she is everything
Or she might see the fool behind the frown
And then the heart behind the fool
Don't tell her that you need her
Don't tell her that you care
Don't ask her to hold you
Or she might see the fool behind the frown
And then the heart behind the fool
Behind the cool, there's a dreading that
Someday she'll betray you
Someday she will dispose of
All her photographs of you
So don't tell her when you're lonely
Don't tell her when you're blue
Don't tell her she means everything to you
So don't tell her that you need her
Don't tell her that you care
Don't ask her to hold you
Or she might see the fool behind the frown
And then the heart behind the foolEmbed
