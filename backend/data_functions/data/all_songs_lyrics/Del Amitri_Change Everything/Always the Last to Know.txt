Always the Last to Know LyricsSo you're in love with someone else
Someone who burns within your soul
And it looks like I am the last to know
I hear you've never felt so alive
So much desire beyond control
And as usual I am the last to know
The last to know how you're feeling
The last to know where you are
The last to know if you're happy now
Or if he's treating you like I treated you
Or if he's cruel
I'll be the last to know
We spent summers up beyond the bay
And you said these are such perfect days
That if the bomb drops baby
I wanna be the last to know
But now you're living up behind the hill
And though we share the same city and feel the same sun
When your winter comes
I'll be the last to know
Always the last to know how you're feeling
The last to know where you are
The last to know if you're happy now
Or if he's pleaded with you
Like I pleaded with you if you go
Don't let me be the last to know
Don't let me be the last to know
Creation's gone crazy
The TV's gone mad
Now you're the only sane thing that I've had
Always the last to know how you're feeling
The last to know where you are
The last to know if you're happy now
Or if he's cheated on you
Like I cheated on you, oh
You were the last to know
You were the last to know
Don't let me be the last to know
Oh, Oh, Oh
Don't let me be the last to know
No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, NoEmbed
