As Soon As the Tide Comes In Lyrics
You'd better get some sleep for a change
Before tomorrow brings you down
By three o'clock they'll both be sitting on that plane
Hopelessly honeymoon bound
And I hope no one asks you to kiss this bride
Or tie tin cans to the car
And the friends and relations mingle outside
You can linger at the bar

So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon
Let the action begin
'Cause it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time
The bride will be changing and you will be crying
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in

You'll feel like some soap opera star
Predictably hitting the booze
With your standard issue broken heart
You step into your Saturday shoes
And you might feel better if you slapped her face
Or slipped some pills in his wine
But instead some voice in your head keeps saying
You'll look back and laugh sometime
So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon
Let the action begin
'Cause it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time
The bride will be changing and you will be crying
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in
Yeah, it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in

So put on your lipstick and check that your hat's straight too
'Cause if they can go through with this you can do it too

So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon
Let the action begin
'Cause it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time
The bride will be changing and you will be crying
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in
It will be raining as soon as the tide comes in
Yeah, it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in
It will be raining as soon as the tide comes in
