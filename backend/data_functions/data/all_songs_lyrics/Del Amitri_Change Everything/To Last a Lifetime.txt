To Last a Lifetime LyricsRoll down the window, let me hear the rain
Let me hear her whispering, honey everything is OK
Cos I've had enough bad news
To last a lifetime
I've had enough bad news
To last a lifetime
Well I drove all night under a seasick sky
And I made it my mid-afternoon
And I hope she's home so she can hold me tight and tell me
Everything is alright
Cos I've had enough bad news
To last a lifetime
I've had enough bad news
To last a lifetime
And I was struck by how much I remembered
And how everything sill looked the same
When a neighbour I met in her hallway said
"Looks like loverboy's too late again"
So take your troublesome baggage
And put it on the next train home
Cos you can guess somewhere else in the world right now
Someone else feels just as alone
Cos I've had enough bad news
I've had enough bad news
I've had enough bad news
To last a lifetime
To last a lifetime
To last a lifetime
To last a lifetimeEmbed
