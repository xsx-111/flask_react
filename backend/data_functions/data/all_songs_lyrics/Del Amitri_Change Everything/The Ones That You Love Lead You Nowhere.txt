The Ones That You Love Lead You Nowhere LyricsGo and tell your mother, go and tell your friends
You've been fooled again
He appeared like magic and he left you on a late night train
Yeah, some things never change
Cos baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere
Yeah baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere
If you could just be patient, pretty soon you would forget his name
And face this world again
If you could just stop looking for someone special
You might save yourself some pain
Cos baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere
Yeah baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere
Every little lie makes you look so dumb
They tell you nobody has ever come as close as you've come
So baby tonight you've got the right to feel so numb
Cos baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere
Yeah baby the ones that you love lead you nowhereEmbed
