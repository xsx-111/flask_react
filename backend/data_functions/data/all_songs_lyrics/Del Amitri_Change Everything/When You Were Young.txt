When You Were Young LyricsLook at the fool you have been
They drained the pool while you drowned in the dream
They bought your beauty and your soul
Then softly sold you back what they stole
So look into the mirror do you recognise someone
Is it who you always hoped you would become
When you were young
The disappointment of success
Hangs from your shoulders like a hand-me-down dress
And down nostalgia's rocky road
You watch your former lovers growing old
So look into the mirror do you recognise someone
Is it who you always hoped you would become
When you were young
Sometimes your lack of sympathy gets hard to explain
So on your mask of make-up you just paint
A little parody of pain
So I look into the mirror and I recognise someone
It is who you always hoped you would become
When you were youngEmbed
