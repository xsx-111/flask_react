Sometimes I Just Have to Say Your Name LyricsWith the sweet drip of every raindrop
Time brings you closer to me
And with each new sign at every train-stop
Another hour without you is consigned to history
And with each tick of my alarm clock
I get crazy for the days to get to you
When I can hold you and kiss you have you
Instead of staring at some photo like a fool
But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight
When I think that I might not make it through
But honey, sometimes I just have to say your name
To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same
And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do
To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name
So this morning I picked up a paper
In the useless descent of the rain
While partners in heartbreak the whole world over
Lie and cheat just the same
And the headlines proclaim everything has changed
Love can't save you now
As each little motion of my wristwatch
Holds up my faith somehow
But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight
When I think that I might not make it through
But honey, sometimes I just have to say your name
To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same
And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do
To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name
When I've used up all my patience
When your letters have been read twenty times through
I can drink all the wine in this place of mine
But it ain't no replacement
It ain't no replacement for youEmbed
