Jackass Lyrics
Alright!

To know you is to hate you
So loving you must be like suicide
Well, I don't mind if you don't mind
Well, I am not the one that's gonna die
I guess I just can't listen
To this one-sided conversation again
'Cause I don't care if I don't care
Well, no one ever said that life is fair

Well, everybody loves a joke, but no one likes a fool
And you're always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse, and that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

The center of attention
Got an honorable mention once again
Congratulations and salutations
You're a figment of your own imagination

Well, everybody loves a joke, but no one likes a fool
And you're always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse, and that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

To know you is to bait you
And you fell victim to your own denial
Well, I don't mind if you don't mind
You're wasting all your time6Embed
