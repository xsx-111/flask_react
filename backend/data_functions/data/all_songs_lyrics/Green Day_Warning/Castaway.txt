Castaway Lyrics
Cha!

I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
I'm leaving in a lurch and I'm taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission into destination unknown
An expedition into Desolation Road

Where I'm a castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)

Lost and found, trouble bound, castaway

I'm riding on the night train and driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out on the boulevard
Spontaneous combustion on the corners of my mind
I'm leaving in a lurch and I'm taking back what's mine
I'm on a mission into destination unknown
An expedition into Desolation Road

Where I'm a castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)

Lost and found, trouble bound, castaway


I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
I'm leaving in the lurch and I'm taking back what's mine

I'm on a mission into destination unknown
An expedition into Desolation Road

Where I'm a castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Castaway (Going at it alone)
Castaway (Now I'm on my own)
Lost and found, trouble bound, castaway

Castaway
Castaway (Castaway)
