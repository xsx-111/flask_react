Blood, Sex, and Booze Lyrics
Head down! Head down! Head down!
Do you understand me?!
Aw shit!

Waiting in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged up
To a chair, it's so unfair
I don't dare to move
For the pain she puts me through
Is what I need, so make it bleed

I'm in distress
Oh, mistress, I confess
So do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me

Say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called "Kill"
My head is in the gutter
Thank you, sir, strike up another
Mandolin of discipline
Throw me to the dogs
Let them eat my flesh down
To the wood, it feels so good

I'm in distress
Oh, mistress, I confess
So do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me

Say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called "Kill"

Ch... Whoo!
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm in distress
Oh, mistress, I confess
So do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me

Ah! Whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh
I'll show you a real time!6Embed
