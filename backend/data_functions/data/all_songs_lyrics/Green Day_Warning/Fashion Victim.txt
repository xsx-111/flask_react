Fashion Victim Lyrics
He's a victim of his own time
In his vintage suit and tie
He's a casualty dressed to the teeth
In the latest genocide
The new seasons come and go
At the dog and pony show
Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names
And to follow your dress codes
What's in a name? Hey!

She's a scented magazine
Looking sharp and living clean
Living well and dressed to kill
But she looks like hell to me
When you're dancing through your wardrobe
Do the anorex-a-go-go
Cloaked with style for pedophiles
As your credit card explodes

Well, you auction off your life
For the most expensive price
Going once, going twice, it's gone
Alright, hey!

Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

Well, you auction off your life (Going once)
For the most expensive price (Twice, it's gone)
Going once, going twice, it's gone

Alright, hey!

What's in a name? Hey!
What's in a name? Hey!
What's in a name?3Embed
