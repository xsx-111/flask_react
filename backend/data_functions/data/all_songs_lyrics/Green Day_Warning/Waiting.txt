Waiting Lyrics
I've been waiting a long time
For this moment to come, I'm
Destined for anything at all
Downtown, lights will be shining
On me like a new diamond
Ring out under the midnight hour
Well, no one can touch me now, well
And I can't turn my back, it's
Too late, ready or not at all

Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known... Wake up!

Dawning of a new era
Calling, don't let it catch ya
Falling, ready or not at all
Oh, so close enough to taste it
Almost, I can embrace this
Feeling on the tip of my tongue

Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known... Wake up!
You better thank your lucky stars!
Say, hey, hey!


Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known... Wake up!

You better thank your lucky stars!
Say, hey, hey!

I've been waiting a lifetime
For this moment to come, I'm
Destined for anything at all
Dumbstruck, color me stupid
Good luck, you're gonna need it
Where I'm going, if I get there at all
Wake up! You better thank your lucky stars!8Embed
