Minority Lyrics
I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog, there of which I stand alone
A face in the crowd unsung against the mold
Without a doubt, singled out, the only way I know

'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marching out of time
To my own beat, now
The only way I know

One light, one mind flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud," she screamed unto me
A free-for-all, fuck 'em all, you are your own sight
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority (Hey!)


One light, one mind, flashing in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For crying out loud," she screamed unto me
A free-for-all, fuck 'em all, you are your own sight

'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority

I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority
I wanna be the minority11Embed
