Church on Sunday Lyrics
Ooh-ooh

Today is the first day of the rest of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend everything's alright, now
I'm not getting any younger as long as you don't get any older
I'm not gonna say that yesterday never was

Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face, leaving traces of my mistakes
When I say

If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise

I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth
And nothing but that truth is what I'll ever hear from you, now
"Trust" is a dirty word that comes from such a liar
But respect is something I will earn if you have faith
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
Making your mascara bleed
Tears down your face, leaving traces of my mistakes
When I say

If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise

Let's go!
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh

If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
And this compromise
Yes, I'll compromise6Embed
