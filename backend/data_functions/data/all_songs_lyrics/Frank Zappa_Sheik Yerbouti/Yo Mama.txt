Yo Mama LyricsMaybe you should stay with yo' mama
She could do your laundry 'n' cook for you
Maybe you should stay with yo' mama
You're really kinda stupid 'n' ugly too
Maybe you should stay with yo' mama
She could do your laundry 'n' cook for you
Maybe you should stay with yo' mama
You're really kinda stupid 'n' ugly too
You ain't really made for bein' out in the street
Ain't much hope for a fool like you
Cause if you play the game, you will get beat
Maybe you should stay with yo' mama
She could do your laundry 'n' cook for you
Maybe you should stay with yo' mama
You're really kinda stupid 'n' ugly too
And
You should never smoke in pajamas
You might start a fire 'n' burn yer face
Maybe you'll return to Managua
You could go unnoticed in such a placeEmbed
