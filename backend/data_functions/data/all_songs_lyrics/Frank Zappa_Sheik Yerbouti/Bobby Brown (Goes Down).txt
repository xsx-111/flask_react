Bobby Brown (Goes Down) Lyrics
Hey there, people, I'm Bobby Brown
They say I'm the cutest boy in town
My car is fast, my teeth is shiney
I tell all the girls they can kiss my heinie
Here I am at a famous school
I'm dressin' sharp and I'm actin' cool
I got a cheerleader here wants to help with my paper
Let her do all the work and maybe later I'll rape her

Oh God I am the American dream
I do not think I'm too extreme
An' I'm a handsome son of a bitch
I'm gonna get a good job and be real rich
(Get a good, get a good, get a good, get a good job)

Women's Liberation
Came creepin' all across the nation
I tell you people, I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of Freddie
She made a little speech then
Aw, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vise, but she left the dick
I guess it's still hooked on, but now it shoots too quick
Oh God I am the American dream
But now I smell like Vaseline
An' I'm a miserable sonofabitch
Am I a boy or a lady... I don't know which
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder)

So I went out and bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but I'm still kinda cute
Got a job doin' radio promo
And none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo
Eventually me and a friend
Sorta of drifted along into S&M
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
As long as I gets a little golden shower

Oh God I am the American dream
With a spindle up my butt till it makes me scream
An' I'll do anything to get ahead
I lay awake nights sayin,' "Thank you, Fred!"
Oh God, Oh God, I'm so fantastic!
Thanks to Freddie, I'm a sexual spastic
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now; I'm goin' down
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now; I'm goin' down
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now; I'm goin' down
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now; I'm going down
Haha, yeah, I knew you'd be surprised5Embed
