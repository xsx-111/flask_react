Wait a Minute LyricsListen to him go!
Wait a minute; we gotta get somethin' happenin' here
He's in there spendin' thousands of dollars 'n' shit...
We should make this worthwhile
We should
We should get into something REAL
Ho Ho
LEATHER!
No, man, he's not interested in Leather...shit
That shit's been fuckin' rubbed in the ground
Hmmmm
Christ, that's goin' on two tours old now...
We gotta come up with some new shit...Embed
