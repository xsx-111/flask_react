Wall of Love LyricsOoh great wall of love, build me a great wall of love
When the blind man sings about the peaceful things
You shout that it's not good enough
Ah we wait till daylight hours
Waiting for a sign from you
Golden temples concrete towers
Building mansions on the hillside next to you
In the city souls awaken bodies shaking
Oh pull me up let me see the view
And to the hungry in the gutter
We've deprived them bread and butter
Always not enough
No not enough
Great wall of love, build me a great wall of love
When the blind man sings about the peaceful things
You shout that it's still not enough
Ah well it's not the sound of ghosts I hear
It's the devil with his chainsaw
And I'll be running through the ghettos
Through the townships of Soweto
Always not enough
No not enough
Brothers missing, babies kissing
And the thing that got to you
Burning never turning next to you
Ooh great wall of love
Build me a great wall of love
When the blind man sings about the peaceful things
You shout that it's still not enough
So listen to me darling
They've got worries they've got troubles on their mind
And when you hear them reaching out
They're reaching out for something they can't find
Oh I believe one great day the rain will come
And wash this mess away
Oh I believe one great day the rain will come
They've got silver and diamonds
They've got paradise around them
They've got blue skies so clear
They've got their prisoner in a wagon
While the children chase the dragon
And the free bird files so clear
It files away
Fly fly fly away
Fly away
Oh you fly away
And may your sweet lips sing to me
Let the bells ring wherever freedom be
One babe is born and another one dies
There's people making love tonight
People making love tonight
Ah people making love tonight
People making love
People making love tonight
People making love
I can hear them reaching out
I can hear them reaching out
I can hear them reaching out
I can hear them reaching outEmbed
