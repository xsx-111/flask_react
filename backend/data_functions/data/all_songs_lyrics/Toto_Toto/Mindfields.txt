Mindfields Lyrics
There's a rumor of a midnight man, so silent in disguise
And every time he looks your way, you can see it in his eyes
Like a window to the storm, he invades your paradise
Don't you buy what he is selling - it's just lies
When he says "these hearts are willing"
The story goes, "these dreams are free"
Only takes a moment, but you must acclimatize
Don't you buy what he is selling - it's just lies

Over your left shoulder, I have seen the angry beast
Heard the war horns screaming, as they gather for the feast
Seen a star-crossed angel with the Death card and a shield

We're walking through mindfields
You see an angel and she takes you by the hand
We're walking through mindfields
Her lips are moving, like she's praying
We're walking through mindfields
She speaks so softly and you want to understand
What she's saying

There's a stairway leading to the sun - I walk it in my sleep
And a ship of fools above the sky, who've gotten in too deep
With a doorway into nowhere, and the path is way too steep
Don't you lose your angry soul, it's yours to keep
Where it ends, it's the beginning
And it stays, right to the end
The reason is unclear, my friend, it almost makes me weep
Don't you lose your soul, it's yours to keep

Over your left shoulder, I have seen the angry beast
Heard the war horns screaming, as they gather for the feast
Seen a star-crossed angel with the Death card and a shield

We're walking through mindfields
You see an angel and she takes you by the hand
We're walking through mindfields
Her lips are moving, like she's praying
We're walking through mindfields
She speaks so softly and you want to understand
What she's saying


Over your left shoulder, I have seen the angry beast
Heard the war horns screaming, as they gather for the feast
Seen a star-crossed angel with the Death card and a shield
We're walking through mindfields
You see an angel and she takes you by the hand
We're walking through mindfields
Her lips are moving, like she's praying
We're walking through mindfields
She speaks so softly and you want to understand
What she's saying
We're walking through mindfields
You see an angel and she takes you by the hand
(Brother, take me by the hand!)
We're walking through mindfields
Her lips are moving, like she's praying
We're walking through mindfields
She speaks so softly and you want to understand
What she's sayingEmbed
