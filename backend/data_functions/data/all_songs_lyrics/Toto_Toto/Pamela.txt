Pamela Lyrics
Oh!
Yeah

Side by side
I'll be yours forever
Yes, I will
Rain or shine
Any kind of weather
Any kind

There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
Let's take what's getting old and make it new
Oh!

Eye to eye
It's a blinding confrontation
You and I
We're a deadly combination

So don't start mixing truth with jealousy
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine
Just remember, it may not heal this time
Pamela, there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Yeah, I love you, little girl...
Oh!

Black and white always go together
Day and night, you're the precious jewel I treasure

Wanting every part of you is not a crime
Could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time?

Pamela, don't break this heart of mine
Just remember, it may not heal this time
Pamela, there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
All, yeah!


Oh, Pamela (Oh, Pamela)
Thousands of miles away, but always in my heart

Pamela, don't break this heart of mine
Just remember, it may not heal this time
Pamela, there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Pamela, don't break this heart of mine
Just remember, it may not heal this time
Pamela, there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
It all behind!
