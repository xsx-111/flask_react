On The Run LyricsEverybody's moving way too fast
Before you blink you better find out who's in your path
The pressure's building up on every side
In my heart I know that I've got nothing to hide
What would make you think that you're the only one
Now I know my troubles have just begun
I'm on the run and nobody's stopping me
I'm on the run and there's nobody left on my side
I'm on the run and I know you're watching me
There's not enough time to decide
You never know what the night could bring
Every moment all the angels begin to sing
Why the worry - just to save your pride
With all the answers buried so deep inside
It doesn't take a crystal ball to see the truth
It's gonna take a miracle to see this thing through
I'm on the run and nobody's stopping me
I'm on the run and there's nobody left on my side
I'm on the run and I know you're watching me
There's not enough time to decide
I'm on the run and nobody's stopping me
I'm on the run and there's nobody left on my side
I'm on the run and I know you're watching me
There's not enough time to decide
I'm on the run and nobody's stopping me
I'm on the run and there's nobody left on my side
I'm on the run and I know you're watching me
There's not enough time to decideEmbed
